* Org-article class
  :PROPERTIES:
  :VISIBILITY: children
  :END:
This file uses Babel to tangle a LaTeX class named =org-article.cls=.
The class provides all of the LaTeX packages used by the Org-mode
LaTeX exporter.  The class accepts numerous options, which the user
can set either in =.emacs=, for default use with all org-article
exports, or within the Org-mode file using =#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS:=.

Some of the features include:
  - Default packages :: Options to keep individual LaTeX packages from
       loading make it somewhat easier to modify which LaTeX packages
       are loaded during the processing of LaTeX code exported by
       Org-mode.
  - Fonts :: The package also implements several choices of fonts and
             takes steps to ensure that the fonts don't clash with the
             symbol font files that Org-mode depends upon to typeset
             =org-entities=.
  - Listing themes :: The class provides pre-defined themes for
                      formatting source code listings, which can be
                      used as is, or used as a basis for minor modifications.
  - Compact lists :: A facility to typeset lists with less vertical
                     space is provided.
  - Double spacing :: An option is provided to set lines double spaced.
  - Table of contents :: The table of contents depth can be set
       independently of section numbering depth.
  - Section numbering :: Section numbering depth can be specified
       independently of the table of contents depth.

** How to use this Org-mode document
   :PROPERTIES:
   :VISIBILITY: folded
   :END:

You might be able to get the Org-mode document from GitHub using the following
shell command:

#+source: get-from-github-alt
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  git clone git://github.com/tsdye/org-article.git
#+end_src

This will create a sub-directory, =org-article=, initialize the git
repository and download the file =article-class.org= as part of the
repository.  The Org-mode document can be tangled to produce the
=org-article.cls= file.  This is done by running =org-babel-tangle=
against the file, either by =M-x org-babel-tangle RET= or =C-c C-v
[C-]t=.

The resulting =org-article.cls= file should then be moved where LaTeX
can find it.  In LaTeX setups that conform to the [[http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/tds/tds.html][Tex Directory
Structure]], this might be path/to/texmf-local/tex/latex/base.  Once
the file has been placed in an appropriate directory it is often the
case that the directory database, such as the one maintained by
[[http://tug.org/kpathsea/][Kpathsea]], must then be updated. The following shell commands work on
my OS-X system with the [[http://tug.org/mactex/][MacTeX]] distribution:

#+source: install-org-article
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  sudo cp org-article.cls /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/base/
  sudo mktexlsr
  kpsewhich org-article.cls
#+end_src
** Org-mode LaTeX export setup
   :PROPERTIES:
   :VISIBILITY: folded
   :END:
# <<export-setup>>
There are two ways to setup =org-article.cls= and your choice will
probably depend on the value of the variable
=org-export-latex-packages-alist=.  If this variable is nil (or it
refers to packages that you always want loaded), then the following
setup should work for you.  It asks Org-mode *not* to load the default
packages, because these are loaded by =org-article.cls=.  Then, it
loads the packages in =org-export-latex-packages-alist=, which should
consist of a single entry for the =inputenc= package.  Org-mode
automatically sets the input encoding based on the status of the
Org-mode buffer being exported, which it can't do if it is loaded by
=org-article.cls=.  Finally, any packages specified in the Org-mode
buffer are loaded (the [EXTRA] argument).

The =org-article.cls= setup for the case when
=org-export-latex-packages-alist= is =nil=:

The number of heading levels in the LaTeX output is determined by two
factors: the number of heading levels (section, subsection, etc.)
defined in =org-export-latex-classes= and the setting of the =H:=
option in the export header.  The number of heading levels will be the
smaller of the two values, e.g., if =H: 5= calls for five heading
levels, but only sections are defined in =org-export-latex-classes=
then the exported LaTeX file will only contain sections and will lack
subsections, subsubsections, etc.  Similarly, if headings down to
subparagraph are defined in =org-export-latex-classes= and =H: 1=,
then only sections will appear in the LaTeX export.  In a practical
sense, the only reason to restrict the number of headings specified in
=org-export-latex-classes= would be to constrain the options available
to the author of the document.  Thus, =org-article.cls= defines
headings to the subparagraph level, which is the maximum defined by LaTeX.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (setq org-export-latex-listings t)
  (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-packages-alist
               '(("AUTO" "inputenc" t)))
  (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-classes
            '("org-article"
               "\\documentclass{org-article}
               [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]
               [PACKAGES]
               [EXTRA]"
               ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
               ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
               ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
               ("\\paragraph{%s}" . "\\paragraph*{%s}")
               ("\\subparagraph{%s}" . "\\subparagraph*{%s}")))
#+end_src

If, for some reason, =org-export-latex-packages-alist= is not =nil=,
and it includes packages that you don't want always loaded then
the following setup should work.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (setq org-export-latex-listings t)
  (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-classes
               '("org-article"
                 "\\documentclass{org-article}
                   [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]
                   [EXTRA]"
                 ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\paragraph{%s}" . "\\paragraph*{%s}")
                 ("\\subparagraph{%s}" . "\\subparagraph*{%s}")))
#+end_src

In this case, you will need to specify the =inputenc= package in the
Org-mode file:

#+source: specify-inputenc
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[AUTO]{inputenc} 
#+end_src

** Examples
The functionality of =org-article.cls= can be demonstrated with the
following two examples of pdf output generated by Org-mode LaTeX
export of this Org-mode file.  In the first, these three lines appear
near the top of the Org-mode file:

#+source: first-example
#+begin_src org :exports code
#+OPTIONS:   H:5 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:nil -:t f:t *:t <:t
#+LaTeX_CLASS: org-article
#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [article,letterpaper,times,12pt,listings-bw,microtype]
#+end_src

The resulting [[http://www.tsdye2.com/org-babel/article-class-times-art.pdf][pdf file]] is typeset with the standard LaTeX
=article.cls= on 8.5 x 11 in. paper, using Times, Helvetica, and
Courier fonts with a 12 point base size.  Source code listings are
given in black and white, and microtypographic justification is
applied.

In the second example, these three lines appear near the top of the
Org-mode file:

#+source: second-example
#+begin_src org :exports code
#+OPTIONS:   H:5 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:nil -:t f:t *:t <:t
#+LaTeX_CLASS: org-article
#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [koma,a5paper,landscape,twocolumn,utopia,10pt,listings-sv,microtype,paralist]
#+end_src

The resulting [[http://www.tsdye2.com/org-babel/article-class-utopia-koma.pdf][pdf file]] is typeset with the KOMA-script =scrartcl.cls=
on 5.8 x 8.3 in. paper in landscape mode, using Utopia, Bera,
and Incosolata fonts with a 10 point base size.  Source code listings
are given in color, and microtypographic justification is applied.  In
addition, the =paralist= option has been set; compare the tightly-set
list immediately below with the standard list of the first example.

In the third example, these three lines appear at the top of the
Org-mode file:

#+source: third-example
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+OPTIONS:   H:5 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:nil -:t f:t *:t <:t
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS: org-article
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [koma,a5paper,DIV=15,landscape,utopia,10pt,listings-sv,microtype,paralist]
#+end_src

The resulting [[http://www.tsdye2.com/org-babel/article-class-koma-div.pdf][pdf file]] is typeset with the KOMA-script =scrartcl.cls=
on 5.8 x 8.3 in. paper in landscape mode, using Utopia, Bera, and
Incosolata fonts with a 10 point base size.  The size of the text
block has been increased by setting =DIV= to a relatively high number.
Source code listings are given in color, and microtypographic
justification is applied.  In addition, the =paralist= option has been
set.

The fourth example, set out in the listing below, illustrates use of
the =org-article.cls= section numbering facility.  The option
=secnums= has been used to number section heads but leave subsection
and lower level heads unnumbered.  This [[http://www.tsdye2.com/org-babel/article-class-secnum.pdf][results]] in a clean look.  The
=listings-es= theme has been used for the listings, which uses color
sparingly and sets code blocks off primarily by numbering and small
size of the font.
 
#+source: fourth-example
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+OPTIONS:   H:5 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:nil -:t f:t *:t <:t
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS: org-article
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [koma,letterpaper,utopia,11pt,listings-es,microtype,paralist,colorlinks=true,urlcolor=blue,secnums]
#+end_src

* The class file
   :PROPERTIES:
   :VISIBILITY: folded
   :END:
The LaTeX class file has six standard parts:

   - Identification part :: Defines the nature of the file and
        specifies the TeX format that it requires.
   - Initial code part :: Loads packages used internally by the class file.
   - Declaration of options part :: All options known to the class are
        declared here.  It is forbidden to load packages in this part.
   - Execution of options part :: Set default values and execute the
        code for the options that have been declared.
   - Package loading part :: Load packages with the options specified
        in the declaration of options part using =\PassOptionsToPackage=.
   - Main code part :: Usually used to define new commands and structures.

#+source: org-article
#+begin_src latex :tangle org-article.cls :noweb yes :exports none
  <<identification-part>>
  <<initial-code-part>>
  <<declaration-of-options-part>>
  <<execution-of-options-part>>
  <<package-loading-part>>
  <<class-code-part>>
#+end_src

** Identification part

This is a standard identification part.  The =\NeedsTeXFormat= command
can take an optional argument with a release date for the oldest
version of LaTeX that can use the class.  Since it is relatively easy
to update LaTeX installations nowadays there is less reason to use
this optional argument than there was in the past.  It is omitted here.

#+source: identification-part
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  % Identification part
  \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
  \ProvidesClass{org-article}[2010/09/21 0.2 (TSD)]
  % End of the identification part
  %
#+end_src

** Initial code part
The initial code part loads packages needed to process the class file
and declares booleans for each of the class options.  Options defined
by the base class, either the standard =article.cls= or the Koma class
=srcartcl.cls=, are passed on to those classes by default and don't
have to be declared here.

#+source: initial-code-part
#+begin_src latex :noweb yes :exports code
  % Initial code part

  \RequirePackage{ifthen}
  \RequirePackage{calc}
  \RequirePackage{ifpdf}

  % End of initial code part
#+end_src
  
** Declaration of options part
# <<declaration>>
The package options are declared here in a code block made up entirely
of noweb references.  Typically, a package referred to here will also
appear in the [[package-loading-part][package loading part]].  The [[package-loading-part][package loading part]] also
consists of noweb references, an arrangement that makes it possible to
keep all the code specific to a particular package together in the
[[latex-packages][LaTeX packages]] section.

#+source: declaration-of-options-part
#+begin_src latex :noweb yes :exports none

  % Base class
  <<pass-to-koma>>
  <<pass-to-article>>  

  % Pass options to packages
  <<options-to-hyperref>>
  
  % End of declaration of options part
#+end_src

** Execution of options part

The =\ProcessOptions= command reclaims the memory used to store user
options, so those values are now gone unless something was done with
them in the [[declaration][declaration of options]] part.

#+source: execution-of-options-part
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  % Execution of options part

  \ProcessOptions\relax

  
  % End of execution of options part
#+end_src

** Package loading part
# <<package-loading-part>>

By default, =org-article.cls= loads all but one of the packages in
=org-export-latex-default-packages-alist=.  It does not load
=inputenc= directly, but instead relies on the Org-mode LaTeX exporter
to load this package, which passes as an option the encoding scheme of the
exported buffer.  The =fontenc= package is loaded with the T1 option
by default as a prerequisite for the various symbol packages.  There
is no facility to disable loading =fontenc=, which is unusual among
LaTeX packages in its ability to be loaded more than once.  This
functionality is required in the case where two or more fonts with different
encodings are used.

This code block is implemented as noweb references so that
package-specific code can be kept together in [[latex-packages][LaTeX packages]].

#+source: package-loading-part
#+begin_src latex :noweb yes :exports none
  % Package loading part
  
  % Base class

  <<load-palatino>>  
  <<load-charter>>  
  <<load-utopia>>  

  % Hyperref asks to be loaded last
  <<load-hyperref>>  
  
  % End of package loading part
  %
#+end_src

** Class code part
# <<class-code-part>>

This part is also implemented with noweb references.  It calls
package-specific setup routines that are defined in the [[latex-packages][LaTeX packages]]
section.

#+source: class-code-part
#+begin_src latex :exports none :noweb yes
  % Class code part
  <<setspace-code>>
  <<listings-code>>
  <<path-code>>
  <<gantt-code>>
  % End of class code part  
#+end_src

* New commands
=Org-article.cls= defines new LaTeX command to identify semantic
elements for particular handling in the output file.

Arbitrary semantic markup is implemented by defining a new link type
in =.emacs=.  The following code block defines a new link type,
=latex=, whose =path= argument can hold the name of any LaTeX command.
A link such as =[latex:proglang][Org-mode]= will export
=\proglang{Org-mode}= to the LaTeX file.  In this way, it is possible
to make the Org-mode LaTeX exporter conform to the semantic markup
defined in arbitrary style files.  Org-mode will even complete your
new link type!

#+source: path-code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (org-add-link-type
   "latex" nil
   (lambda (path desc format)
     (cond
      ((eq format 'html)
       (format "<span style=\"color:grey;\">%s</span>" desc))
      ((eq format 'latex)
       (format "\\%s{%s}" path desc)))))
  
#+end_src

** The \path command
It is often the case that paths are long and difficult to break
at the end of a line.  One way to get line breaks right is to wrap a
path in the =\url{}= command from the =url.sty= package.  However, if the
hyperref package is loaded, it redefines the =\url{}= command to add a
hypertext link.  The original behavior of the =\url{}= command is then
made available with the command =\nolinkurl{}=. Thus, the =\path{}=
command tests for the presence of the hyperref package to ensure that
the proper command is used to typeset a path.

#+source: path-command
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{nohyperref}}%
  {\newcommand{\path}[1]{\url{#1}}}%
  {\newcommand{\path}[1]{\nolinkurl{#1}}}
#+end_src

* LaTeX packages
   :PROPERTIES:
   :VISIBILITY: folded
   :END:
# <<latex-packages>>

** Article base class options

=Org-article.cls= offers a choice of two base classes.  The first is the
standard LaTeX =article.cls=.  Also available is the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] 
=scrartcl.cls=.  The KOMA-script =scrartcl.cls= is compatible with the
standard LaTeX article class; input that compiles with =article.cls=
should also compile with =scrartcl.cls=.  It differs in the layout of
the page and the styling of page elements, producing a somewhat more
"modern" design based on principles set out by the typographer and
book designer [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Tschichold][Jan Tschichold]].  

To select the standard LaTeX =article.cls=, put this in your Org-mode
document:

#+source: org-buffer-article
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [article]
#+end_src

To select the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] =scrartcl.cls=, put this in your Org-mode document:

#+source: org-buffer-koma
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [koma]
#+end_src
 

For information on the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] =scrartcl.cls=, you can probably read the
documentation on your system with the following shell command:

#+source: read-koma
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc koma
#+end_src


#+source: option-koma
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{koma}
  \DeclareOption{koma}{\setboolean{koma}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: option-article
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{article}
  \DeclareOption{article}{\setboolean{article}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: pass-to-koma
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \DeclareOption*{\PassOptionsToClass{\CurrentOption}{scrartcl}}
#+end_src

#+source: pass-to-article
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \DeclareOption*{\PassOptionsToClass{\CurrentOption}{article}}
#+end_src

The article class is loaded by default.

#+source: load-base-class
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{koma}}
  {%
    \LoadClass{scrartcl}%
  }%
  {%
  \LoadClass{article}%
  }  
#+end_src

*** Paper size

The following paper size options are available for the standard LaTeX
=article.cls= and the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] =scrartcl.cls=.  The first three
options are [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#North_American_paper_sizes][North American paper sizes]].  The =a4paper=, =a5paper=, =b4paper=,
and =b5paper= options are [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#The_international_standard:_ISO_216][international standard ISO 216]].  The
=landscape= option orients the paper with the long axis horizontal. 

#+source: paper-sizes
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [letterpaper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [legalpaper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [executivepaper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [a4paper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [a5paper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [b4paper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [b5paper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [landscape]
#+end_src

The [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] =scrartcl.cls= has options for a fuller range of the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#The_international_standard:_ISO_216][international standard ISO 216]] paper sizes, in addition to the
=a4paper=, =a5paper=, =b4paper=, and =b5paper= sizes offered by the
standard LaTeX =article.cls=.  In the example below, X is
replaced by an integer [0, 1, ... 10].
 
#+source: koma-paper-sizes
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [aXpaper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [bXpaper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cXpaper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [dXpaper]  
#+end_src

*** Font size

There are three base font size options available for the standard
LaTeX =article.cls= and the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] =scrartcl.cls=.  This option
sets the size of the main text in the body of the document.  Other
fonts used in the document design, such as headers, footers, heads,
sub-heads, etc., will be scaled accordingly.

#+source: font-sizes
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [10pt]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [11pt]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [12pt]
#+end_src

*** Text block and margins
With the =koma= option, the size of the text block and the resulting
margins can be altered using the option =DIV=.  A typical value of
=DIV= is 9. Smaller text blocks with larger margins result when =DIV=
takes a smaller value and larger text blocks with smaller margins
result when =DIV= takes a larger value (fig. \ref{fig:div}).

#+CAPTION: Text block sizes on A4 paper with different values of DIV
#+LABEL: fig:div
#+ATTR_LaTeX: width=0.5\textwidth
#+results:
[[file:../images/org-article-text-blocks.png]]


The =koma= class can also take into account the part of the page used
by the binding.  This value is passed to the package with the option
=BCOR=, which takes any LaTeX length as its argument.

For example, to set the text block large and leave ample space for
binding with a clip, one might pass the following options to the class
when using the =koma= option.
#+source: koma-text-block
#+begin_src org :exports code

*** Table of contents
In the default configuration, the Org-mode LaTeX exporter includes a
function that sandwiches the LaTeX =\tableofcontents= command between
a command that sets the depth of the headings that appear in the table
of contents (based on the number of headline levels that will be
exported as headings, rather than lists) and a command to add some
vertical space.  Neither of these additions to the =\tableofcontents=
command is especially desireable.  It is often the case that one wants
the table of contents depth to differ from the depth to which sections
are numbered.  In the LaTeX world, the space between the end of one
element and the start of another is something that is specified within
a class file, rather than within the document itself.  Formatting with
the class style exclusively can give the finished document a pleasing
stylistic uniformity that is difficult to achieve in an ad hoc way.
Fortunately, the LaTeX exporter is coded in such a way that it is
possible for the user to alter this behavior relatively easily.

The =org-article.cls= makes it possible to set the depth of headings that
appear in the table of contents independent of the level to which
section headings are numbered.  This mechanism will only work if the default behavior of the LaTeX
exporter is changed.  The following bit of Emacs lisp code can be
placed in =.emacs=:

#+source: format-toc
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (defun org-export-latex-format-toc-org-article (depth)
    (when depth
      (format "\\setcounter{secnumdepth}{%s}\n\\tableofcontents\n"
              depth)))
  (setq org-export-latex-format-toc-function 'org-export-latex-format-toc-org-article)
#+end_src
This code uses the depth to which Org-mode headlines are exported to
sections, rather than lists, as the default level to which sections
are numbered.  This is fine for many applications, but it is possible
to control this variable separately, as [[section-numbering][shown below]].

Three choices are available in =org-article.cls=: sections,
subsections, and subsubsections.  It would be possible to create other
choices, but it is generally the case that one, two, or three heading
levels are sufficient for the table of contents.  More levels are
rarely seen and are perhaps not too desireable.

#+source: toc-depth-text-block
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [tocdepths,tocdepthss,tocdepthsss]
#+end_src

#+source: option-tocdepth

  \DeclareOption{tocdepthss}{\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}}}
  \DeclareOption{tocdepthsss}{\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{tocdepth}{3}}}
#+end_src

*** Section numbering
# <<section-numbering>>

It is possible to set the level to which sections will be numbered
with =org-article.cls=.  

#+source: format-toc-for-secnum
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (defun org-export-latex-format-toc-org-article-sec-num (depth)
    (when depth
      (format "%% Org-mode is exporting headings to %s levels.\n\\tableofcontents\n"
              depth)))
  (setq org-export-latex-format-toc-function 'org-export-latex-format-toc-org-article-sec-num)
#+end_src

Five choices are available in =org-article.cls=: sections,
subsections, subsubsections, paragraphs, and subparagraphs.

#+source: sec-number-text-block
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [secnums,secnumss,secnumsss,secnump,secnumsp]
#+end_src

#+source: option-secnum
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{secnums}
  \newboolean{secnumss}
  \newboolean{secnumsss}  
  \newboolean{secnump}
  \newboolean{secnumsp}
  \DeclareOption{secnums}{\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{secnumdepth}{1}}}
  \DeclareOption{secnumss}{\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{secnumdepth}{2}}}
  \DeclareOption{secnumsss}{\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}}}
  \DeclareOption{secnump}{\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{secnumdepth}{4}}}
  \DeclareOption{secnumsp}{\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{secnumdepth}{5}}}
#+end_src


*** Equations

The standard LaTeX =article.cls= and the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] =scrartcl.cls=
both recognize two options that control formatting of equations.  The
option =leqno= will number equations on the left, rather than the
right, which is the default.  The option =fleqn= displays equations
flush left, rather than centered, which is the default

#+source: equations
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [leqno]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [fleqn]
#+end_src

*** Table captions

The standard LaTeX =article.cls= formats captions to appear below the
captioned item.  However, many document styles require table captions
above the table.  Users of =article.cls= typically use a package,
[[http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id%3Dtopcapt][=topcapt.sty=]], and place the command =\topcaption{}= above the
captioned item.  With the Org-mode LaTeX exporter, this requires
changes to the exported LaTeX code.  The [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] =scrartcl.cls=
provides an option that gets rid of the need for =topcapt.sty=:

#+source: koma-caption
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [captions=tableheading]
#+end_src

** Org-mode default packages

*** Inputenc                                                       :noexport:

The input encoding of the document is specified by the =inputenc= package.  It
takes one of the following options:

#+source: inputenc-options
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [ascii]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin1] 
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin2]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin3] 
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin4] 
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin5]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin9] 
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin10]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [decmulti]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp850]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp852]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp858]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp437]

  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp1250]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp1252]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp1257]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [ansinew]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [utf8]
#+end_src

The package documentation describes each of these options.  You can
probably read the documentation for =inputenc= with the following shell
command:
#+source: read-inputenc
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc inputenc
#+end_src

This is a standard Org-mode package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-inputenc
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [noinputenc]
#+end_src
 

#+source: option-inputenc
#+begin_src latex :exports none
  \newboolean{noinputenc}  
  \DeclareOption{noinputenc}{\setboolean{noinputenc}{true}}  
#+end_src

#+source: load-inputenc
#+begin_src latex :exports none
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{noinputenc}}
  {}

#+end_src

#+source: options-to-inputenc
#+begin_src latex :exports none
  \DeclareOption*{%
    \PassOptionsToPackage{\CurrentOption}{inputenc}
  }
#+end_src

*** Inputenc
The input encoding of the document is specified by the =inputenc=
package.  Org-mode provides a nifty method for sending options to this
package, so it is not loaded directly by =org-article.cls=.  See
[[export-setup][Org-mode LaTeX export setup]].

*** Fontenc

The =fontenc= package specifies the encoding to use with a font.  The
history of font encodings in LaTeX is a long one; suffice it to say
that the most common option is =T1=, also known as the Cork encoding
because it was formulated at a EuroTeX conference in Ireland's County
Cork.  The =fontenc= package pretends that it was never loaded so that
it can be called several times with different options to load fonts
that have various encodings.

You can probably read the documentation for =fontenc= on your system
with the following shell command:

#+source: read-fontenc
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc fontenc
#+end_src

This is a standard Org-mode package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-fontenc
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [nofontenc]
#+end_src
 
Note that several of the font packages load =fontenc= themselves.
These include [[garamond-font][Garamond]], [[palatino-font][Palatino]], [[charter-font][Charter]], and [[utopia-font][Utopia]].

#+source: option-fontenc
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{nofontenc}  
  \DeclareOption{nofontenc}{\setboolean{nofontenc}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-fontenc
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{nofontenc}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}}
#+end_src

#+source: options-to-fontenc
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \DeclareOption*{%
    \PassOptionsToPackage{\CurrentOption}{fontenc}
  }
#+end_src

*** Fixltx2e
The =fixltx2e= package applies fixes to LaTeX2e that would break older
documents, so have not been applied to the LaTeX2e kernel.  The
package doesn't take any options.

You can probably read about =fixltx2e= on your system by issuing the
following shell command:

#+source: read-fixltx2e
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc fixltx2e
#+end_src
 

This is a standard Org-mode package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-fixltx2e
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [nofixltx2e]
#+end_src
 
#+source: option-fixltx2e
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{nofixltx2e}
  \DeclareOption{nofixltx2e}{\setboolean{nofixltx2e}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-fixltx2e
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{nofixltx2e}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{fixltx2e}}
#+end_src

*** Graphicx
The =graphicx= package is typically configured with *.def files
because the facilities it specifies are provided by a graphics driver,
rather than by LaTeX.  For this reason, it is typically loaded without
options. 

You should be able to read about =graphicx=, along with its companion
packages =color= and =graphics= by issuing the following shell
command:

#+source: read-graphicx
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc graphicx
#+end_src


This is a standard Org-mode package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-graphicx
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [nographicx]
#+end_src
 
#+source: option-graphicx
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{nographicx}
  \DeclareOption{nographicx}{\setboolean{nographicx}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-graphicx
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{nographicx}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{graphicx}}
#+end_src

*** Longtable
The =longtable= package defines a new LaTeX environment that can be
used in place of the =tabular= environment and can be broken by the
TeX page-breaking algorithm.  It is used, as the name implies, by long
tables that typically won't fit onto a single page.  The package is
loaded without option.

You should be able to read the =longtable= documentation on your
system by issuing the following shell command:

#+source: read-longtable
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc longtable
#+end_src


This is a standard Org-mode package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-longtable
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [nolongtable]
#+end_src

#+source: option-longtable
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{nolongtable}
  \DeclareOption{nolongtable}{\setboolean{nolongtable}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-longtable
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{nolongtable}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{longtable}}
#+end_src

*** Float
Tables and figures in LaTeX are treated as floating objects.
Internally, they are treated as a single (large) glyph, which makes
them difficult to place on a page of otherwise small glyphs.
Consequently, they are allowed to "float" until a suitable location is
found.  The =float= package provides facilities to define new floating
environments, to restyle the existing float environments, and
additionally defines a placement parameter, =[H]=, that keeps a float
from floating.  The package is loaded without options.

You can probably read about the =float= package on your system by
issuing the following shell command:

#+source: read-float
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc float
#+end_src


This is a standard Org-mode package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-float
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [nofloat]
#+end_src

#+source: option-float
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{nofloat}
  \DeclareOption{nofloat}{\setboolean{nofloat}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-float
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{nofloat}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{float}}
#+end_src

*** Wrapfig
The =wrapfig= package defines two new environments to set a narrow
float at the edge of the text and wrap the text around it.  Because
"floats" in these new environments do not float it is sometimes the
case that they appear out of order, e.g. =Figure n= appears before
=Figure n-1=.  Caveat emptor.

The package is loaded without options.

The documentation for this package is included at the end of the package source.
You should be able to read it on your system by issuing the following
shell command:

#+source: read-wrapfig
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc wrapfig
#+end_src

This is a standard Org-mode package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-wrapfig
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [nowrapfig]
#+end_src
 
#+source: option-wrapfig

#+end_src

#+source: load-wrapfig
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{nowrapfig}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{wrapfig}}
#+end_src

*** Soul
The =soul= package is used primarily for underlining text.  It is
loaded without options.

You can probably read the =soul= documentation on your system by
issuing the following shell command:

#+source: read-soul
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc soul
#+end_src

This is a standard Org-mode package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-soul

  {\RequirePackage{soul}}
#+end_src

*** T1enc                                                          :noexport:

  {\RequirePackage{t1enc}}
#+end_src

*** Textcomp
This package provides support for the Text Companion fonts, which
provide symbols used by =org-entities=, in particular the Euro
currency symbol.  It is loaded without options.

This is a standard Org-mode package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-textcomp
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [notextcomp]
#+end_src
 

#+source: option-textcomp

#+end_src

#+source: load-textcomp
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{notextcomp}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{textcomp}}
#+end_src

*** MarVoSym
The =marvosym= package provides support for Martin Vogel's Symbol
font, some glyphs from which are required by =org-entities=.  The
package is loaded without options.

You can probably read about the =marvosym= package by issuing the
following command in the shell:

#+source: read-marvosym
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc marvosym
#+end_src

This is a standard Org-mode package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: load-marvosym
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{nomarvosym}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{marvosym}}
#+end_src

*** Wasysym
The =wasysym= package makes available some symbol glyphs from the
=wasy= fonts.  It is needed to support some of the glyphs in
=org-entities=.  When it is loaded without options, this package clashes
with the American Mathematical Society's =amsmath= package.  Using
the =nointegrals= option resolves this clash:

#+source: wasysym-options
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [integrals, nointegrals]
#+end_src

You can probably read the wasysym documentation on your system by
issuing the following shell command:

#+source: read-wasysym
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc wasysym
#+end_src

This is a standard Org-mode package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

  {%
    \ifthenelse{\boolean{integrals}}%
    {\RequirePackage[integrals]{wasysym}}%
    {\RequirePackage[nointegrals]{wasysym}}%
  }
#+end_src

*** Latexsym
The =latexsym= package provides a few glyphs, one or more of which
might be required by =org-entities=.  According to the documentation,
=latexsym= isn't needed if the =amssymb= package is loaded.

You can probably read about the =latexsym= package on your system by issuing the
following shell command:

#+source: read-latexsym
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc latexsym
#+end_src

This is a standard Org-mode package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: load-latexsym
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{nolatexsym}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{latexsym}}
#+end_src

*** Amssymb
This package provides all the symbols defined in the American
Mathematical Society's [[http://www.ams.org/publications/authors/tex/amsfonts][symbol fonts]] =msam= and =msbm=.  They are
required to support =org-entities=.  It is superseded by the
=mathdesign= package, which is used by various fonts.  If one of these
is specified, then the =amssymb= package is not loaded. If the package is
loaded, the it is loaded without options.

You can probably read the =amssymb= package documentation by issuing
the following shell command:

#+source: read-amssymb
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc amssymb
#+end_src

This is a standard Org-mode package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-amssymb
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [noamssymb]
#+end_src

#+source: option-amssymb
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{noamssymb}
  \DeclareOption{noamssymb}{\setboolean{noamssymb}{true}}
#+end_src

Isn't loaded if Times, Charter, Utopia, or Garamond are loaded.  These
use the =mathdesign= package, which apparently supersedes =amssymb=.

#+source: load-amssymb
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{noamssymb}\or\boolean{utopia}\or\boolean{charter}\or\boolean{garamond}\or\boolean{times}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{amssymb}}
#+end_src

*** Hyperref
The =hyperref= package turns LaTeX cross-referencing commands into
hyperlinks, including the table of contents, bibliography, etc.  It is
typically configured on a site-wide basis with options kept in a file,
=hyperref.cfg=.  The LaTeX document loads the package without
specifying any options.  The =hyperref= package redefines many LaTeX
commands, so it needs to be loaded at, or near the end of, the [[package-loading-part][package
loading part]]. 

The =hyperref= package accepts numerous options, which can be given as
=key = value= pairs.  Boolean options default to =true= when passed
without a value.  Options are passed in the usual way, and
=org-article.cls= simply passes them on to =hyperref=.

#+source: hyperref-options

** Font packages
LaTeX documents might need three text fonts, one for the serif
typeface used for text, the sans-serif typeface often used for heads
and sub-heads, and the monospace typewriter typeface typically used to
set code examples and the like.  Each of the following options
specifies all three of the fonts, but takes its name after the serif
font used to set text.

*** Times
# <<times-font>>

The =times= option uses URW Nimbus Roman, a Times clone, for the serif
font, URW Nimbus Sans, a Helvetica clone, for the sans-serif font,
and URW Nimbus Mono, a Courier clone, for the typewriter font.  This
is a standard set of common typefaces typically used in scientific
publications.  All of the fonts should be included in a typical LaTeX
distribution. 

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Roman][Times New Roman]] was designed by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Morison][Stanley Morison]] for /The Times/ of
London during a redesign of the newspaper prompted, in part, by
Morison's criticism of its typography in 1929.  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica][Helvetica]] was
developed in 1957 by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Miedinger][Max Miedinger]].  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface)][Courier]] was designed by Howard
Kettler in 1955 for use in IBM typewriters.

Helvetica looks better if it is set slightly smaller than the serif
font.

*** Garamond
# <<garamond-font>>

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamond][Garamond]] refers to a group of old-style serif typefaces and is named
after the sixteenth-century type designer, Claude Garamond.  It is an
elegant typeface.  The sans-serif font is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Vera][Bera]], an adaptation of a font
originally named Vera.  It was designed by Jim Lyles.  The typewriter
font is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inconsolata][Inconsolata]], which was created by Raph Levien and is based on Vera.

*** Palatino
# <<palatino-font>>

The beautiful, old-style serif font, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatino][Palatino]], was designed by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Zapf][Herman
Zapf]].  It is somewhat heavier and easier to read than [[garamond-font][Garamond]].  It is
paired here with Helvetica and Courier, as is [[times-font][Times]],
for which it is an alternative.

*** Utopia
# <<utopia-font>>

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(typeface)][Utopia]] is a transitional serif font designed by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Slimbach][Robert Slimbach]] for
Adobe in 1989.  It became free software in 2006.  It is paired here
with Bera and Inconsolata, as is [[garamond-font][Garamond]].

Note that the utopia font clashes with the =amssymb= package.

#+source: org-buffer-utopia

*** Charter
# <<charter-font>>

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Charter][Charter]] was designed to reproduce well on low-resolution 300 dpi
printers.  It is paired here with Helvetica and Courier, like [[times-font][Times]],
for which it is an alternative.

These fonts conflict with the =amssymb= package.

#+source: org-buffer-charter

  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [charter]
#+end_src
 
#+source: option-charter

  \DeclareOption{charter}{\setboolean{charter}{true}}
#+end_src

Helvetica is set a bit smaller to better match the Charter font.

#+source: load-charter
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{charter}}
  {%
    \ifpdf
     \RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}

     \RequirePackage[scaled=.90]{helvet} 
     \RequirePackage{courier} % tt
    \fi}%
  {}
#+end_src

** Other packages
Packages not included in the Org-mode list of default packages are
made available in =org-article.cls=.  These include facilities to
apply microtypographic adjustments to suitable fonts, set the line
spacing of the document to double space, set lists more compactly than
the standard LaTeX =article.cls=, and typeset source code listings
using one of several color or black and white themes.

*** Microtype

The =microtype= package makes available the micro-typographic
extensions of pdfTeX.  Prominent among these are font expansion and
character protrusion, which together result in fewer bad line breaks
and a visually even right margin.  

You can probably read the =microtype= documentation, which runs to
more than 200 pages, on your system by issuing the shell command:

#+source: read-microtype
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc microtype
#+end_src


This package is not loaded by default.  An option is provided to load
it.

#+source: org-buffer-microtype

  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [microtype]

    \ifthenelse{\boolean{microtype}}
  {%
    \ifpdf
     \RequirePackage{microtype}
    \fi}%
  {}
#+end_src

*** Setspace

The =setspace= package is used here for the sole purpose of creating
double-spaced documents, such as manuscripts submitted to some
publishing houses.  If it is loaded, then the option =doublespace=
will produce a double-spaced document.

This package is not loaded by default.  An option is provided to load
it, and to set linespacing to doublespace.

#+source: org-buffer-setspace
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [setspace,doublespace]

  {\singlespacing}}%
  {}%
#+end_src

*** Paralist

The =paralist= package was designed to meet the widespread request for
more tightly set lists in the standard LaTeX classes.  If it is
loaded, then the LaTeX environments =itemize=, =enumerate=, and
=description= are over-ridden by their paralist counterparts.

You can probably read the =paralist= documentation on your system by
issuing the shell command:

#+source: read-paralist
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc paralist
#+end_src


This package is not loaded by default.  An option is provided to load
it.

#+source: org-buffer-paralist

  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [paralist]

  \newboolean{paralist}
  \DeclareOption{paralist}{\setboolean{paralist}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-paralist
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  % Set the standard LaTeX list environments to their compact counterparts  
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{paralist}}
    {%
      \RequirePackage{paralist}
      \let\itemize\compactitem%
      \let\description\compactdesc%
      \let\enumerate\compactenum%
    }
    {}
#+end_src

*** Topcapt                                                        :noexport:
The =topcapt= package is needed when it is desired to set the caption
of a table above the table.  In this case, the =\caption{}= command
must be moved above the =tabular= environment and the command changed
to =\topcaption=.  These will be adjustments made to the code produced
by the Org-mode LaTeX exporter.

This package is not loaded by default.  An option is provided to load
it.

#+source: org-buffer-topcapt
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [topcapt]

  \ifthenelse{\boolean{topcapt}}
    {\RequirePackage{topcapt}}

*** Color                                                          :noexport:
The =xcolor= package provides facilities for adding color to LaTeX
output.  This package needs additional configuration.  It should take
options. 

#+source: org-buffer-color
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [color]
#+end_src

#+source: option-color
#+begin_src latex :exports code

#+end_src

#+source: load-color
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{color}}
    {\RequirePackage{color}}
    {}
#+end_src

*** Listings
The =listings= package is a source code printer for LaTeX.  Except for
the two options =draft= and =final=, which the =listings= package is
configured to pick up itself from options passed to =\documentclass=,
the other options were introduced to ease debugging or to trigger
compatibility with earlier versions of the package.  It seems unwise
to use this mechanism to set options for the =listings= package
because there is no reason to assume that it will be stable.  One
solution would be to process options for this package using a =key =
value= interface that sets the values of keys recognized by the
package's =lstset= function.  This is relatively difficult to do.  An
easier approach groups package options into themes, which can be
selected with simple options, rather than =key = value= pairs.  It is
the approach adopted here.

This package is not loaded by default.  Options are provided to load
it in its default state, set up for black and white reproduction, and
with two themes for color reproduction.

#+source: org-buffer-listings
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [listings, listings-bw, listings-color, listings-sv]
#+end_src
 
Themes are defined for the listings package.  The
=listings-color= theme was lifted from a post to the Org-mode list by
Eric Schulte.  The =listings-sv= theme was posted to the list by
Sebastian Vauban; it has been modified here to work with the =color=
package, rather than the =xcolor= package used by Sebastian, and to
allow breaking of long lines.

Caveat emptor: the line-breaking mechanism in the listings package appears to
break when =resetmargins = false=.  This means that the listing will
always be set to =\textwidth=, rather than =\linewidth=.  Thus, care
should be taken to ensure that listings do not occur in lists.
Probably the best way to ensure that this doesn't happen is to make
sure the =H:= option in the export header is set to a suitably high
level, so source code blocks always occur at an Org-mode headline
level that exports as a heading, rather than a list, e.g. if source
code appears in a three-asterisk headline and now lower, then setting
=H: 3= should ensure that listing margins are always aligned with text
margins.

*** Minted                                                         :noexport:

Minted is a LaTeX package for formatting source code.  It is an
alternative to the listings package.  It relies on an external piece
of software called Pygments that needs to be installed separately.

*** GANTT charts
Eric Fraga wrote this GANTT chart constructor, powered by an Org-mode
table.  For everyday use, it requires that some Emacs lisp code be
installed in the Library of Babel.

**** GANTT Emacs lisp code

The GANTT Emacs lisp code can either be placed in the buffer with the
GANTT chart table or it can be installed in the [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Library-of-Babel.html#Library-of-Babel][Library of Babel]].
Installing local code in the Library of Babel is best accomplished by
establishing one or more Org-mode files for this purpose and keeping
them in a place that won't be overwritten when Org-mode is updated.
For each of these local files, place a line like the following in
=.emacs= to make the source code blocks accessible to the Library:

#+source: load-local-lob
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (org-babel-lob-ingest "~/org/local-lob.org")
#+end_src

The following source code block sent to the Org-mode list by Eric
Fraga has been modified slightly.  It should be installed in the
Library of Babel.

#+begin_example
#+source: elispgantt
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :var table=gantttest

**** The GANTT Option
The GANTT facility can be loaded by adding the following line to the
Org-mode buffer.

#+source: org-buffer-gantt
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [gantt]
#+end_src

#+source: option-gantt
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{gantt}
  \DeclareOption{gantt}{\setboolean{gantt}{true}}
#+end_src

The GANTT code requires the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/pgf.html][pgf]] LaTeX packages written by Till Tantau.
#+source: load-gantt
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{gantt}}
  {\RequirePackage{pgf, pgfarrows, pgfnodes, tikz}}
  {}
#+end_src

Eric wrote several LaTeX commands to make the translation from
Org-mode table to GANTT chart.

**** Input Table

The Org-mode table that Eric used to test his code is named
=ganttesttable=.  Perhaps the best way to understand its structure is
to compare it to the GANTT chart it produces.

**** Creating the GANTT chart
In the Org-mode buffer, the call to the code in the Library of Babel
passes =ganttesttable= to the function =elispgantt=.  Note that the
header argument is set in the function call.

,#+lob: elispgantt(table=gantttesttable) :results output latex

The resulting GANTT chart is processed by LaTeX and appears in the PDF
output without reference to an external file.  The chart does not appear in
the HTML export.  The chart looks great, Eric!
