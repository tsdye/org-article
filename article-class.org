This file uses [[latex:proglang][Org-mode's]] Babel facilities to tangle a [[latex:proglang][LaTeX]] class
named [[latex:classfile][Org-article]].  The class is designed to work with [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] LaTeX
export and provides all of the LaTeX packages used by the exporter.
The class accepts numerous options, which the user can set either in
=.emacs=, for default use with all [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] exports, or within the
[[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] file itself using =#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS:=.

Some features of [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] include:
  - Default [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] packages :: Options to keep individual LaTeX
       packages from loading make it somewhat easier to modify which
       packages are loaded during the processing of LaTeX code
       exported by [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]]
  - Fonts :: The package implements several choices of fonts and
             takes steps to ensure that the fonts don't clash with the
             symbol font files that [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] depends upon to typeset
             [[latex:progstruct][org-entities]]
  - Source code :: The class supports both the [[latex:package][listings]] and
                      the [[latex:package][minted]] packages for syntax highlighting and
                      typesetting of source code
  - Compact lists :: A facility to typeset lists with less vertical
                     space between entries is provided
  - Double spacing :: An option is provided to set lines double spaced
  - Table of contents :: The table of contents depth can be set
       independently of section numbering depth
  - Section numbering :: Section numbering depth can be specified
       independently of the table of contents depth
  - Key=value options :: [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] implements key=value options
       using [[latex:package][pgfkeys]] and [[latex:package][pgfopts]]
  - Semantic markup :: Facilities are provided for semantic markup in
       the domain of computer programming

** How to get this Org-mode document
   :PROPERTIES:
   :VISIBILITY: folded
   :END:

You might be able to get the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] document from GitHub using the following
shell command:

#+source: get-from-github-alt
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  git clone git://github.com/tsdye/org-article.git
#+end_src

This will create a sub-directory, =org-article=, initialize the git
repository and download the file =article-class.org= as part of the
repository.  

** How to make and install the class file
The [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] document can be tangled to produce the
=org-article.cls= file.  This is done by running [[latex:progstruct][org-babel-tangle]] 
against the file, either by =M-x org-babel-tangle RET= or =C-c C-v
[C-]t=.

The resulting =org-article.cls= file should then be moved where LaTeX
can find it.  This can be the directory where the LaTeX file(s) will
be compiled or another location for use system-wide.  In LaTeX setups
that conform to the [[http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/tds/tds.html][Tex Directory Structure]], this system-wide location
might be [[latex:path][path/to/texmf-local/tex/latex/base]].  

Once the file has been placed in an appropriate directory it is often
the case that the directory database, such as the one maintained by
[[http://tug.org/kpathsea/][Kpathsea]], must then be updated. The following shell commands work on
my OS-X system with the [[http://tug.org/mactex/][MacTeX]] distribution:

#+source: install-org-article
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  sudo cp org-article.cls /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/base/
  sudo mktexlsr
  kpsewhich org-article.cls
#+end_src

** LaTeX export setup
   :PROPERTIES:
   :VISIBILITY: folded
   :END:
# <<export-setup>>

[[latex:classfile][Org-article]] requires that the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] environment be set up before LaTeX
export.  How the environment is set up will depend on the LaTeX packages you
typically load, 

There are two ways to set up [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] and your choice will probably
depend on the value of the variable [[latex:progstruct][org-export-latex-packages-alist]].
If this variable is nil (or it refers to packages that you always want
loaded), then the following setup should work for you.  It asks
[[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] *not* to load the default packages, because these are loaded
by [[latex:classfile][Org-article]].  Then, it loads the packages in
[[latex:progstruct][org-export-latex-packages-alist]], which should consist of a single
entry for the [[latex:package][inputenc]] package.  [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] automatically sets the
input encoding based on the status of the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] buffer being
exported, which it can't do if it is loaded by [[latex:classfile][Org-article]].  Finally,
any packages specified in the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] buffer are loaded (the [EXTRA]
argument).

*** Set up if org-export-latex-packages-alist is nil

The number of heading levels in the LaTeX output is determined by two
factors: the number of heading levels (section, subsection, etc.)
defined in [[latex:progstruct][org-export-latex-classes]] and the setting of the [[latex:progstruct][H:]]
option in the export header.  The number of heading levels will be the
smaller of the two values, e.g., if [[latex:progexample][H: 5]] calls for five heading
levels, but only sections are defined in [[latex:progstruct][org-export-latex-classes]]
then the exported LaTeX file will only contain sections and will lack
subsections, subsubsections, etc.  Similarly, if headings down to
subparagraph are defined in [[latex:progstruct][org-export-latex-classes]] and  [[latex:progexample][H: 1]],
then only sections will appear in the LaTeX export.  In a practical
sense, the only reason to restrict the number of headings specified in
[[latex:progstruct][org-export-latex-classes]] would be to constrain the options available
to the author of the document.  Thus, [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] defines
headings to the subparagraph level, which is the maximum defined by LaTeX.

#+source: packages-alist-not-nil
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (require 'org-latex)
  (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-packages-alist
               '(("AUTO" "inputenc" t)))
  (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-classes
            '("org-article"
               "\\documentclass{org-article}
               [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]
               [PACKAGES]
               [EXTRA]"
               ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
               ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
               ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
               ("\\paragraph{%s}" . "\\paragraph*{%s}")
               ("\\subparagraph{%s}" . "\\subparagraph*{%s}")))
#+end_src

*** Set up if org-export-latex-packages-alist is not nil

If, for some reason, [[latex:progstruct][org-export-latex-packages-alist]] is not [[latex:progstruct][nil]],
and it includes packages that you don't want always loaded then
the following setup should work.

#+source: packages-alist-not-nil
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (require 'org-latex)
  (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-classes
               '("org-article"
                 "\\documentclass{org-article}
                   [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]
                   [EXTRA]"
                 ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\paragraph{%s}" . "\\paragraph*{%s}")
                 ("\\subparagraph{%s}" . "\\subparagraph*{%s}")))
#+end_src

In this case, you will need to specify the [[latex:package][inputenc]] package in the
[[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] file, as follows:

#+source: specify-inputenc
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[AUTO]{inputenc} 
#+end_src

** Export configuration
Execute one of the following code blocks to set up your system to export
to LaTeX.  The first sets up the environment when the [[latex:package][minted]] package
is used.  The second sets it up for the [[latex:package][listings]] package.

#+source: config-with-minted
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb tangle :exports code :results silent
  <<define-latex-link>>
  <<define-inline-link>>
  <<format-toc-for-secnum-with-listings>>
  <<special-blocks>>
  <<minted-setup>>
#+end_src

#+source: config-with-listings
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb tangle :exports code :results silent
  <<define-latex-link>>
  <<define-inline-link>>
  <<format-toc-for-secnum-with-listings>>
  <<special-blocks>>
  <<listings-setup>>
#+end_src

This document contains [[latex:proglang][Python]], LaTeX, and [[latex:proglang][shell]] source code
blocks that can be evaluated.  The variable [[latex:progstruct][org-babel-load-languages]]
should enable these languages with a setting in .emacs that contains
the following lines:

#+source: babel-load-languages
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((emacs-lisp . t)
     (latex . t)
     (python . t)))
#+end_src

** Requirements
[[latex:classfile][Org-article]] requires a working LaTeX installation.  Most of the
packages that it uses will be included in a modern LaTeX installation,
with the possible exception of some of the font packages.  Certain
distributions package these separately; it is up to you to install the
fonts you choose to use.  If you have problems with fonts, then the
[[times-font][times]] option might be a good choice, since it relies on
widely distributed fonts---Times, Helvetica, and Courier.

When a package is not widely distributed, then shell source code to
download the package is provided.  These packages can either be placed
in the directory where the LaTeX files will be compiled, or they can
be installed at an appropriate place in the TeX directory structure.

Finally, [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] requires a working [[latex:proglang][Python]] installation for its
implementation of certain features, in particular future support for the
[[latex:package][minted]] package, which uses a [[latex:proglang][Python]] library for syntax highlighting of
source code in a wide variety of programming languages.

** Examples
The functionality of [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] can be demonstrated with the
following two examples of pdf output generated by [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] LaTeX
export of this [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] file.  In the first, these three lines appear
near the top of the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] file:

#+source: first-example
#+begin_src org :exports code
#+OPTIONS:   H:5 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:nil -:t f:t *:t <:t
#+LaTeX_CLASS: org-article
#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [article,letterpaper,times,12pt,listings-bw,microtype]
#+end_src

The resulting [[http://www.tsdye2.com/org-babel/article-class-times-art.pdf][pdf file]] is typeset with the standard LaTeX
[[latex:classfile][article]] on 8.5 x 11 in. paper, using Times, Helvetica, and
Courier fonts with a 12 point base size.  Source code listings are
given in black and white, and microtypographic justification is
applied.

In the second example, these three lines appear near the top of the
[[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] file:

#+source: second-example
#+begin_src org :exports code
#+OPTIONS:   H:5 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:nil -:t f:t *:t <:t
#+LaTeX_CLASS: org-article
#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [koma,a5paper,landscape,twocolumn,utopia,10pt,listings-sv,microtype,paralist]
#+end_src

The resulting [[http://www.tsdye2.com/org-babel/article-class-utopia-koma.pdf][pdf file]] is typeset with the KOMA-script [[latex:classfile][scrartcl]]
on 5.8 x 8.3 in. paper in landscape mode, using Utopia, Bera,
and Incosolata fonts with a 10 point base size.  Source code listings
are given in color, and microtypographic justification is applied.  In
addition, the [[latex:progstruct][paralist]] option has been set; compare the tightly-set
list immediately below with the standard list of the first example.

In the third example, these three lines appear at the top of the
[[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] file:

#+source: third-example
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+OPTIONS:   H:5 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:nil -:t f:t *:t <:t
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS: org-article
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [koma,a5paper,DIV=15,landscape,utopia,10pt,listings-sv,microtype,paralist]
#+end_src

The resulting [[http://www.tsdye2.com/org-babel/article-class-koma-div.pdf][pdf file]] is typeset with the KOMA-script [[latex:classfile][scrartcl]]
on 5.8 x 8.3 in. paper in landscape mode, using Utopia, Bera, and
Incosolata fonts with a 10 point base size.  The size of the text
block has been increased by setting [[latex:progstruct][DIV]] to a relatively high number.
Source code listings are given in color, and microtypographic
justification is applied.  In addition, the [[latex:progstruct][paralist]] option has been
set.

The fourth example, set out in the listing below, illustrates use of
the [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] section numbering facility.  The option
[[latex:progstruct][secnums]] has been used to number section heads but leave subsection
and lower level heads unnumbered.  This [[http://www.tsdye2.com/org-babel/article-class-secnum.pdf][results]] in a clean look.  The
[[latex:progstruct][listings-es]] theme has been used for the listings, which uses color
sparingly and sets code blocks off primarily by numbering and small
size of the font.
 
#+source: fourth-example
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+OPTIONS:   H:5 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:nil -:t f:t *:t <:t
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS: org-article
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [koma,letterpaper,utopia,11pt,listings-es,microtype,paralist,colorlinks=true,urlcolor=blue,secnum=section]
#+end_src

The LaTeX class file has six standard parts:

   - Identification part :: Defines the nature of the file and
        specifies the TeX format that it requires.
   - Initial code part :: Loads packages used internally by the class file.
   - Declaration of options part :: All options known to the class are
        declared here.  It is forbidden to load packages in this part.
   - Execution of options part :: Set default values and execute the
        code for the options that have been declared.
   - Package loading part :: Load packages with the options specified
        in the declaration of options part using [[latex:progstruct][PassOptionsToPackage]].
   - Main code part :: Usually used to define new commands and structures.

  <<package-loading-part>>
  <<class-code-part>>
#+end_src

** Identification part

This is a standard identification part.  The [[latex:progstruct][NeedsTeXFormat]] command
can take an optional argument with a release date for the oldest
version of LaTeX that can use the class.  Since it is relatively easy
to update LaTeX installations nowadays there is less reason to use
this optional argument than there was in the past.  It is omitted here.

#+source: identification-part
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  % Identification part
  \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
  \ProvidesClass{org-article}[2010/09/21 0.2 (TSD)]
  % End of the identification part
  %
#+end_src

** Initial code part
The initial code part loads packages needed to process the class file.  


#+source: initial-code-part
#+begin_src latex :noweb yes :exports code
  % Initial code part

  \RequirePackage{ifthen}
  \RequirePackage{calc}
  \RequirePackage{ifpdf}
  \RequirePackage{remreset}
  \RequirePackage{pgfopts}
  % End of initial code part
#+end_src
  
** Declaration of options part
# <<declaration>>
The package options are declared here in a code block made up entirely
of noweb references.  Typically, a package referred to here will also
appear in the [[package-loading-part][package loading part]].  The [[package-loading-part][package loading part]] also
consists of noweb references, an arrangement that makes it possible to
keep all the code specific to a particular package together in the
[[latex-packages][LaTeX packages]] section.

Options defined by the base class, either the standard [[latex:classfile][article]] or the
Koma class [[latex:classfile][scrartcl]], are passed on to those classes by default and
don't have to be declared here.

#+source: declaration-of-options-part

  % Pass options to packages
  <<options-to-hyperref>>
  
  % End of declaration of options part
#+end_src

** Execution of options part

The [[latex:progstruct][ProcessOptions]] command reclaims the memory used to store user
options, so those values are now gone unless something was done with
them in the [[declaration][declaration of options]] part.

#+source: execution-of-options-part
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  % Execution of options part

  \ProcessPgfOptions{/ORGART}
  \ProcessOptions\relax
  
  % End of execution of options part
#+end_src

** Package loading part
# <<package-loading-part>>

By default, [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] loads all but one of the packages in
[[latex:progstruct][org-export-latex-default-packages-alist]].  It does not load [[latex:package][inputenc]]
directly, but instead relies on the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] LaTeX exporter to load
this package, which passes as an option the encoding scheme of the
exported buffer.  The [[latex:package][fontenc]] package is loaded with the [[latex:progstruct][T1]] option
by default as a prerequisite for the various symbol packages.  There
is no facility to disable loading [[latex:package][fontenc]], which is unusual among
LaTeX packages in its ability to be loaded more than once.  This
functionality is required in the case where two or more fonts with
different encodings are used.

This code block is implemented as noweb references so that
package-specific code can be kept together in [[latex-packages][LaTeX packages]].

#+source: package-loading-part
#+begin_src latex :noweb yes :exports none
  % Package loading part
  
  % Base class
  <<load-base-class>>

  <<load-marvosym>>  
  <<load-wasysym>>  
  <<load-latexsym>>  
  <<load-amssymb>>  
  
  % Other packages

  <<load-microtype>>
  <<load-setspace>>
  % <<load-topcapt>>
  <<load-color>>
  <<load-gantt>>

  % Hyperref asks to be loaded last
  <<load-hyperref>>  
  
  % End of package loading part
  %
#+end_src

** Class code part
# <<class-code-part>>

This part is also implemented with noweb references.  It calls
package-specific setup routines that are defined in the [[latex-packages][LaTeX packages]]
section.

#+source: class-code-part
#+begin_src latex :exports none :noweb yes
  % Class code part
  <<setspace-code>>

  <<progstructs-code>>
  % End of class code part  
#+end_src

* Semantic markup

LaTeX works with semantic markup, where units of meaning are tagged in
the source file.  A style or class file is responsible for typesetting
these appropriately.

It is possible to introduce semantic markup in Org-mode files and
[[latex:classfile][Org-article]] defines a variety of in-line and block-level semantic
markup conventions.

** In-line markup
# <<in-line markup>>

Arbitrary semantic markup in [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] files is implemented by
defining new link types wint [[latex:progstruct][org-add-link-type]].  Two new links are
defined here.  The [[latex-link-type][first code block]]
defines a new link type, [[latex:progstruct][latex]], whose [[latex:progstruct][path]] argument can hold the
name of any LaTeX command.  A link such as
=[latex:proglang][Org-mode]= will export =\proglang{Org-mode}= to the
LaTeX file.

# <<latex-link-type>>
#+source: define-latex-link
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (org-add-link-type
   "latex" nil
   (lambda (path desc format)
     (cond
      ((eq format 'html)
       (format "<span class=\"%s\">%s</span>" path desc))
      ((eq format 'latex)
       (format "\\%s{%s}" path desc)))))
  
#+end_src

[[latex:classfile][Org-article]] defines [[markup-code-snippets][several macros]] for marking up code
snippets.  A separate link type is needed because the markup is
delimited by slashes rather than the curly braces typical of LaTeX.

# <<inline-link-type>>
#+source: define-inline-link
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code :results silent
  (org-add-link-type
   "mint" nil
   (lambda (path desc format)
     (cond
      ((eq format 'html)
       (format "<span class=\"%s\">%s</span>" path desc))
      ((eq format 'latex)
       (format "\\%s/%s/" path desc)))))  
#+end_src

Note that both of the new link definitions assume a [[latex:proglang][CSS]] stylsheet that
defines classes with the same names as their corresponding LaTeX macros.

Using custom links in this way, it is possible to make the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]]
LaTeX exporter honor the semantic markup defined in arbitrary LaTeX
(and CSS) style files.  With TAB, [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] will even help complete
your new link as you type!

*** The path command
# <<path-command>>

It is often the case that paths are long and difficult to break at the
end of a line.  One way to get line breaks right is to wrap a path in
the [[latex:progstruct][path]] command from the [[latex:package][url]] package.  This can be done
with a link such as this one (abbreviated for obvious reasons)
=[latex:path][/path/ ...]=, which gets typeset so it will break at the
end of the line,
[[latex:path][/path/to/a/file/nested/very/deeply/in/the/directory/structure]].

*** Programming languages
# <<proglangs>>

Semantic markup for programming language names, package names, and
class file names is provided with the [[latex:progstruct][proglang]], [[latex:progstruct][package]], and [[latex:progstruct][classfile]]
commands.  [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] currently defines all of these in the same way.

#+source: proglangs-code
#+begin_src latex :exports code

#+source: proglangs-use
#+begin_src org :exports code
  =[[latex:proglangs][Org-mode]]= will set "Org-mode" in sans serif font.
#+end_src

*** Programming constructs
Markup for programming constructs is provided with the [[latex:progstruct][progstruct]]
and [[latex:progstruct][progexample]] commands.  Both are set in monospaced type; the
examples are set at a slightly smaller size.

#+source: progstructs-code
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \let\progstruct=\texttt
  \newcommand{\progexample}[1]{{\ttfamily\small #1}}
#+end_src

** Block-level markup
# <<special blocks>>

Block-level markup is accomplished with the help of the
[[latex:package][org-special-blocks]] package.  It is used in this file to wrap the
[[latex:progstruct][listing]] environment defined by the [[latex:package][minted]] package around a source code
block to get a floating listing in the LaTeX document.  LaTeX will
keep track of floating listings and will also prepare a list of
listings that can be placed between the table of contents and the
first section of the article.  [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] makes the [[latex:progstruct][listing]]
environment available with the [[latex:package][listings]] package, as well, so this
facility can be used regardless of the package chosen to highlight
syntax and typeset source code listings.

Use a construct like this to wrap the source block in a [[latex:progstruct][listing]]
environment.  Typically, you will want to include a figure caption and
a label for cross referencing.  This can be done with a [[latex:progstruct][#+LaTeX:]] line.

 : \#+BEGIN_listing
 :  <source block>
 : #+LATEX: \caption{Source block listing.}\ref{listing:source_block}
 : \#+END_listing

To use this facility, you'll need to load [[latex:package][org-special-blocks]].  This
code can go in =.emacs=, or you can load it for the session by
executing the following source code block with =C-c C-c=.

#+source: special-blocks
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code :results silent
  (require 'org-special-blocks)
#+end_src

The [[latex:package][org-special-blocks]] package leaves it up to the user to see that
the HTML output is styled correctly.  The following line, or something
similar, when added to the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] buffer, styles listings by putting
a black box around them.

 :  \#+STYLE: <style>.listing {margin: 1em; padding: 1em; border: 1px solid black}</style>




Note that the [[latex:progstruct][listing]] environment is implemented in [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] using
the [[latex:package][float]] package to ensure compatability with the environment defined
in the [[latex:package][minted]] package.  The [[latex:classfile][KOMA script scrartcl]] class complains about
this and advises that its own package, [[latex:package][tocbasic]], be used instead.

** Article base class options

[[latex:classfile][Org-article]] offers a choice of two base classes.  The first is the
standard LaTeX [[latex:classfile][article]] class.  Also available is the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]]
[[latex:classfile][scrartcl]] class.  The KOMA-script [[latex:classfile][scrartcl]] is compatible with the
standard LaTeX article class; input that compiles with [[latex:classfile][article]] should
also compile with [[latex:classfile][scrartcl]].  It differs in the layout of the page and
the styling of page elements, producing a somewhat more "modern"
design based on principles set out by the typographer and book
designer [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Tschichold][Jan Tschichold]].

To select the standard LaTeX [[latex:classfile][article]] class, put this line in your [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]]
document:

#+source: org-buffer-article
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [article]
#+end_src

To select the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] [[latex:classfile][scrartcl]] class, put this line in your
[[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] document:

#+source: org-buffer-koma
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [koma]
#+end_src
 

For information on [[latex:classfile][scrartcl]], you can probably read the documentation
on your system with the following shell command:

#+source: read-koma
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc koma
#+end_src


#+source: option-koma
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{koma}
  \DeclareOption{koma}{\setboolean{koma}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: option-article
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{article}
  \DeclareOption{article}{\setboolean{article}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: pass-to-koma
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \DeclareOption*{\PassOptionsToClass{\CurrentOption}{scrartcl}}
#+end_src

#+source: pass-to-article
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \DeclareOption*{\PassOptionsToClass{\CurrentOption}{article}}
#+end_src

The article class is loaded by default.

#+source: load-base-class
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{koma}}
  {%
    \LoadClass{scrartcl}%
  }%
  {%
  \LoadClass{article}%
  }  
#+end_src

*** Paper size

The following paper size options are available for the standard LaTeX
[[latex:classfile][article]] class and the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] [[latex:classfile][scrartcl]] class.  The first three
options are [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#North_American_paper_sizes][North American paper sizes]].  The [[latex:progstruct][a4paper]], [[latex:progstruct][a5paper]], [[latex:progstruct][b4paper]],
and [[latex:progstruct][b5paper]] options are [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#The_international_standard:_ISO_216][international standard ISO 216]].  The
[[latex:progstruct][landscape]] option orients the paper with the long axis horizontal. 

#+source: paper-sizes
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [letterpaper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [legalpaper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [executivepaper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [a4paper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [a5paper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [b4paper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [b5paper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [landscape]
#+end_src

The [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] [[latex:classfile][scrartcl]] class has options for a fuller range of the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#The_international_standard:_ISO_216][international standard ISO 216]] paper sizes, in addition to the sizes
offered by the standard LaTeX [[latex:classfile][article]] class.  In the example below, X
is replaced by an integer [0, 1, ... 10].
 
#+source: koma-paper-sizes
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [aXpaper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [bXpaper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cXpaper]
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [dXpaper]  
#+end_src

*** Font size

There are three base font size options available for the standard
LaTeX [[latex:classfile][article]] and the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] [[latex:classfile][scrartcl]] classes.  This option
sets the size of the main text in the body of the document.  Other
fonts used in the document design, such as headers, footers, heads,
sub-heads, etc., will be scaled accordingly.

#+source: font-sizes
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [10pt]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [11pt]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [12pt]
#+end_src

*** Text block and margins
With the [[latex:progstruct][koma]] option, the size of the text block
and the resulting margins can be altered using the option
[[latex:progstruct][DIV]].  A typical value of
[[latex:progstruct][DIV]] is 9. Smaller text blocks with larger
margins result when [[latex:progstruct][DIV]] takes a smaller value
and larger text blocks with smaller margins result when  [[latex:progstruct][DIV]] takes a
larger value.

#+CAPTION: Text block sizes on A4 paper with different values of DIV.
#+LABEL: fig:div
#+ATTR_LaTeX: width=0.8\textwidth
#+results:
[[file:../images/org-article-text-blocks.png]]


The [[latex:progstruct][koma]] class can also take into account the part of the page used
by the binding.  This value is passed to the package with the option
[[latex:progstruct][BCOR]], which takes any LaTeX length as its argument.

For example, to set the text block large and leave ample space for
binding with a clip, one might pass the following options to the class
when using the [[latex:progstruct][koma]] option.

#+source: koma-text-block
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [koma,DIV=15,BCOR=15mm]
#+end_src

*** Table of contents
In the default configuration, the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] LaTeX exporter includes a
function that sandwiches the LaTeX =\tableofcontents= command between
a command that sets the depth of the headings that appear in the table
of contents (based on the number of headline levels that will be
exported as headings, rather than lists) and a command to add some
vertical space.  Neither of these additions to the =\tableofcontents=
command is especially desireable.  It is often the case that one wants
the table of contents depth to differ from the depth to which sections
are numbered.  Also, in the LaTeX world, the space between the end of one
element and the start of another is something that is specified within
a class or style file, rather than within the document itself.  Formatting with
the class or style file exclusively can give the finished document a pleasing
stylistic uniformity that is difficult to achieve in an ad hoc way.
Fortunately, the LaTeX exporter is coded in such a way that it is
possible for the user to alter this behavior relatively easily.

[[latex:classfile][Org-article]] makes it possible to set the depth of headings that appear
in the table of contents independent of the level to which section
headings are numbered.  This mechanism will only work if the default
behavior of the LaTeX exporter is changed.  The following bit of [[latex:proglang][Emacs
Lisp]] code can be placed in =.emacs=:

#+source: format-toc
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (defun org-export-latex-format-toc-org-article (depth)
    (when depth
      (format "\\setcounter{secnumdepth}{%s}\n\\tableofcontents\n"
              depth)))
  (setq org-export-latex-format-toc-function 'org-export-latex-format-toc-org-article)
#+end_src

#+source: format-toc-with-listings
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (defun org-export-latex-format-toc-org-article-with-listings (depth)
    (when depth
      (format "\\setcounter{secnumdepth}{%s}\n\\tableofcontents\n\\listoflistings\n"
              depth)))
  (setq org-export-latex-format-toc-function 'org-export-latex-format-toc-org-article-with-listings)
#+end_src

This code uses the depth to which [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] headlines are exported to
sections, rather than lists, as the default level to which sections
are numbered.  This is fine for many applications, but it is possible
to control this variable separately, as [[section-numbering][shown below]].

The table of contents depth is set with the [[latex:progstruct][tocdepth]] key.  The
recognized values of =<section>= are =section=, =subsection=,
=subsubsection=, =paragraph=, and =subparagraph=.  These are the
standard LaTeX section names available to articles.

#+source: toc-depth-text-block
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [tocdepth=<section>]
#+end_src

#+source: pgf-option-tocdepth
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \pgfkeys{ 
    /ORGART/.cd, 
    tocdepth/.is choice,
    tocdepth/section/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{tocdepth}{1}}},
    tocdepth/subsection/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}}},
    tocdepth/subsubsection/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{tocdepth}{3}}},
    tocdepth/paragraph/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{tocdepth}{4}}},
    tocdepth/subparagraph/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{tocdepth}{5}}}
  } 
#+end_src

#+source: option-tocdepth
#+begin_src latex :exports none
  \DeclareOption{tocdepths}{\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{tocdepth}{1}}}
  \DeclareOption{tocdepthss}{\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}}}
  \DeclareOption{tocdepthsss}{\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{tocdepth}{3}}}
#+end_src

*** Section numbering
# <<section-numbering>>

It is possible to set the level to which sections will be numbered
with [[latex:classfile][Org-article]].  Sections below this level will have unnumbered
headings.  This requires that the default behavior of the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]]
LaTeX exporter be modified, as follows.

#+source: format-toc-for-secnum
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (defun org-export-latex-format-toc-org-article-sec-num (depth)
    (when depth
      (format "%% Org-mode is exporting headings to %s levels.\n\\tableofcontents\n"
              depth)))
  (setq org-export-latex-format-toc-function 'org-export-latex-format-toc-org-article-sec-num)
#+end_src

#+source: format-toc-for-secnum-with-listings
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (defun org-export-latex-format-toc-org-article-sec-num-with-listings (depth)
    (when depth
      (format "%% Org-mode is exporting headings to %s levels.\n\\tableofcontents\n\\listoflistings\n"
              depth)))
  (setq org-export-latex-format-toc-function 'org-export-latex-format-toc-org-article-sec-num-with-listings)
#+end_src

Section numbering is controlled with the =secnum= key.  [[latex:classfile][Org-article]]
recognizes the following values of =<section>: =none= to inhibit
section numbering altogether; =section=, =subsection=;
=subsubsection=; =paragraph=; and =subparagraph=.

#+source: sec-number-text-block
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [secnum=<section>]
#+end_src

#+source: pgf-option-secnum
#+begin_src latex :exports none
  \pgfkeys{ 
    /ORGART/.cd, 
    secnum/.is choice,
    secnum/none/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{secnumdepth}{0}}},
    secnum/section/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{secnumdepth}{1}}},
    secnum/subsection/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{secnumdepth}{2}}},
    secnum/subsubsection/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}}},
    secnum/paragraph/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{secnumdepth}{4}}},
    secnum/subparagraph/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\setcounter{secnumdepth}{5}}}
  } 
#+end_src

*** Equations

The standard LaTeX [[latex:classfile][article]] class and the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] [[latex:classfile][scrartcl]] class
both recognize two options that control formatting of equations.  The
option [[latex:progstruct][leqno]] will number equations on the left, rather than the
right, which is the default.  The option [[latex:progstruct][fleqn]] displays equations
flush left, rather than centered, which is the default

#+source: equations
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [leqno]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [fleqn]
#+end_src

*** Table captions

The standard LaTeX [[latex:classfile][article]] formats captions to appear below the
captioned item.  However, many document styles require table captions
above the table.  Users of the standard LaTeX [[latex:classfile][article]] class typically
use a package, [[http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id%3Dtopcapt][topcapt]], and place the command [[latex:progstruct][topcaption]] above the
captioned item.  The [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/][KOMA-script]] [[latex:classfile][scrartcl]] class provides an option
that gets rid of the need for [[latex:package][topcapt]]:

#+source: koma-caption
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [captions=tableheading]
#+end_src

** Org-mode default packages

*** Inputenc                                                       :noexport:

The input encoding of the document is specified by the [[latex:package][inputenc]] package.  It
takes one of the following options:

#+source: inputenc-options
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [ascii]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin1] 
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin2]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin3] 
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin4] 
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin5]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin9] 
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [latin10]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [decmulti]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp850]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp852]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp858]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp437]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp437de]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp865]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [applemac]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [macce] 
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [next]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp1250]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp1252]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [cp1257]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [ansinew]
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [utf8]
#+end_src

The package documentation describes each of these options.  You can
probably read the documentation for [[latex:package][inputenc]] with the following shell
command:
#+source: read-inputenc
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc inputenc
#+end_src

This is a standard [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-inputenc
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [noinputenc]
#+end_src
 

#+source: option-inputenc
#+begin_src latex :exports none
  \newboolean{noinputenc}  
  \DeclareOption{noinputenc}{\setboolean{noinputenc}{true}}  
#+end_src

#+source: load-inputenc
#+begin_src latex :exports none
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{noinputenc}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{inputenc}}
#+end_src

#+source: options-to-inputenc
#+begin_src latex :exports none
  \DeclareOption*{%
    \PassOptionsToPackage{\CurrentOption}{inputenc}
  }
#+end_src

*** Inputenc
The input encoding of the document is specified by the [[latex:package][inputenc]]
package.  [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] provides a nifty method for sending options to this
package, so it is not loaded directly by [[latex:classfile][Org-article]].  See
[[export-setup][Org-mode LaTeX export setup]].

*** Fontenc

The [[latex:package][fontenc]] package specifies the encoding to use with a font.  The
history of font encodings in LaTeX is a long one; suffice it to say
that the most common option is [[latex:progstruct][T1]], also known as the Cork encoding
because it was formulated at a EuroTeX conference in Ireland's County
Cork.  The [[latex:package][fontenc]] package pretends that it was never loaded so that
it can be called several times with different options to load fonts
that have various encodings.

You can probably read the documentation for [[latex:package][fontenc]] on your system
with the following shell command:

#+source: read-fontenc
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc fontenc
#+end_src

This is a standard [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-fontenc
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [nofontenc]
#+end_src
 
Note that most of the font sets load [[latex:package][fontenc]] themselves.

#+source: option-fontenc
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{ORGART@nofontenc}  
  \DeclareOption{nofontenc}{\setboolean{ORGART@nofontenc}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-fontenc
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@nofontenc}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}}
#+end_src

#+source: options-to-fontenc
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \DeclareOption*{%
    \PassOptionsToPackage{\CurrentOption}{fontenc}
  }
#+end_src

*** Fixltx2e
The [[latex:package][fixltx2e]] package applies fixes to LaTeX2e that would break older
documents, so have not been applied to the LaTeX2e kernel.  The
package doesn't take any options.

You can probably read about [[latex:package][fixltx2e]] on your system by issuing the
following shell command:

#+source: read-fixltx2e
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc fixltx2e
#+end_src
 

This is a standard [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-fixltx2e
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [nofixltx2e]
#+end_src
 
#+source: option-fixltx2e
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{ORGART@nofixltx2e}
  \DeclareOption{nofixltx2e}{\setboolean{ORGART@nofixltx2e}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-fixltx2e
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@nofixltx2e}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{fixltx2e}}
#+end_src

*** Graphicx
The [[latex:package][graphicx]] package is typically configured with *.def files
because the facilities it specifies are provided by a graphics driver,
rather than by LaTeX.  For this reason, it is typically loaded without
options. 

You should be able to read about [[latex:package][graphicx]], along with its companion
packages [[latex:package][color]] and [[latex:package][graphics]] by issuing the following shell
command:

#+source: read-graphicx
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc graphicx
#+end_src


This is a standard [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-graphicx
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [nographicx]
#+end_src
 
#+source: option-graphicx
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{ORGART@nographicx}
  \DeclareOption{nographicx}{\setboolean{ORGART@nographicx}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-graphicx
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@nographicx}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{graphicx}}
#+end_src

*** Longtable
The [[latex:package][longtable]] package defines a new LaTeX environment that can be
used in place of the =tabular= environment and can be broken by the
TeX page-breaking algorithm.  It is used, as the name implies, by long
tables that typically won't fit onto a single page.  The package is
loaded without option.

You should be able to read the [[latex:package][longtable]] documentation on your
system by issuing the following shell command:

#+source: read-longtable
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc longtable
#+end_src


This is a standard [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-longtable
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [nolongtable]
#+end_src

#+source: option-longtable
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{ORGART@nolongtable}
  \DeclareOption{nolongtable}{\setboolean{ORGART@nolongtable}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-longtable
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@nolongtable}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{longtable}}
#+end_src

*** Float
Tables and figures in LaTeX are treated as floating objects.
Internally, they are treated as a single (large) glyph, which makes
them difficult to place on a page of otherwise small glyphs.
Consequently, they are allowed to "float" until a suitable location is
found.  The [[latex:package][float]] package provides facilities to define new floating
environments, to restyle the existing float environments, and
additionally defines a placement parameter, [[latex:progstruct][{H}]], that keeps a float
from floating.  The package is loaded without options.

You can probably read about the [[latex:package][float]] package on your system by
issuing the following shell command:

#+source: read-float
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc float
#+end_src


This is a standard [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: org-buffer-float
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [nofloat]
#+end_src

#+source: option-float
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{ORGART@nofloat}
  \DeclareOption{nofloat}{\setboolean{ORGART@nofloat}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-float
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@nofloat}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{float}}
#+end_src

*** Wrapfig
The [[latex:package][wrapfig]] package defines two new environments to set a narrow
float at the edge of the text and wrap the text around it.  Because
"floats" in these new environments do not float it is sometimes the
case that they appear out of order, e.g. Figure n appears before
Figure n-1.  Caveat emptor.

The package is loaded without options.

The documentation for this package is included at the end of the package source.
You should be able to read it on your system by issuing the following
shell command:

#+source: read-wrapfig
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc wrapfig
#+end_src

*** MarVoSym
The [[latex:package][marvosym]] package provides support for Martin Vogel's Symbol
font, some glyphs from which are required by [[latex:progstruct][org-entities]].  The
package is loaded without options.

You can probably read about the [[latex:package][marvosym]] package by issuing the
following command in the shell:

#+source: read-marvosym
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc marvosym

  \ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@nomarvosym}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{marvosym}}
#+end_src

*** Wasysym
The [[latex:package][wasysym]] package makes available some symbol glyphs from the
[[latex:package][wasy]] fonts.  It is needed to support some of the glyphs in
[[latex:progstruct][org-entities]].  When it is loaded without options, this package clashes
with the American Mathematical Society's [[latex:package][amsmath]] package.  Using
the [[latex:progstruct][nointegrals]] option resolves this clash:

#+source: wasysym-options
#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [integrals, nointegrals]
#+end_src

You can probably read the wasysym documentation on your system by
issuing the following shell command:

#+source: read-wasysym
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc wasysym
#+end_src

This is a standard [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

  }
#+end_src

*** Latexsym
The [[latex:package][latexsym]] package provides a few glyphs, one or more of which
might be required by [[latex:progstruct][org-entities]].  According to the documentation,
[[latex:package][latexsym]] isn't needed if the [[latex:package][amssymb]] package is loaded.

You can probably read about the [[latex:package][latexsym]] package on your system by issuing the
following shell command:

#+source: read-latexsym
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc latexsym
#+end_src

This is a standard [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided to not load it.

#+source: load-latexsym
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@nolatexsym}}
  {}
  {\RequirePackage{latexsym}}
#+end_src

*** Amssymb
This package provides all the symbols defined in the American
Mathematical Society's [[http://www.ams.org/publications/authors/tex/amsfonts][symbol fonts]] =msam= and =msbm=.  They are
required to support [[latex:progstruct][org-entities]].  It is superseded by the
=mathdesign= package, which is used by various fonts.  If one of these
is specified, then the [[latex:package][amssymb]] package is not loaded. If the package is
loaded, then it is loaded without options.

You can probably read the [[latex:package][amssymb]] package documentation by issuing
the following shell command:

#+source: read-amssymb
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc amssymb
#+end_src

This is a standard [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] package that is loaded by default.  An
option is provided not to load it.

*** Hyperref
The [[latex:package][hyperref]] package turns LaTeX cross-referencing commands into
hyperlinks, including the table of contents, bibliography, etc.  It is
typically configured on a site-wide basis with options kept in a file,
=hyperref.cfg=.  The LaTeX document loads the package without
specifying any options.  The [[latex:package][hyperref]] package redefines many LaTeX
commands, so it needs to be loaded at, or near the end of, the [[package-loading-part][package
loading part]]. 

The [[latex:package][hyperref]] package accepts numerous options, which can be given as
=key = value= pairs.  Boolean options default to =true= when passed
without a value.  Options are passed in the usual way, and
[[latex:classfile][Org-article]] simply passes them on to [[latex:package][hyperref]].

** Font packages
LaTeX documents might need three text fonts, one for the serif
typeface used for text, the sans-serif typeface often used for heads
and sub-heads, and the monospace typewriter typeface typically used to
set code examples and the like.  

The fonts that come with LaTeX distributions differ in their ability
to set complex mathematical expressions.  [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] font sets with math support
include [[garamond-font][Garamond]], [[palatino-font][Palatino]], [[times-font][Times]], and [[utopia-font][Utopia]].

[[latex:classfile][Org-article]] offers a =fontset= key that can be used to specify sets of
all three fonts.  The fonts in each set have been chosen to look good
with one another.  Each set takes its name after the serif font in the
set.

*** Charter
# <<charter-font>>

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Charter][Charter]] was designed to reproduce well on low-resolution 300 dpi
printers.  It is paired here with Helvetica and Courier, like [[times-font][Times]],
for which it is an alternative.  Helvetica is set a bit smaller to
match the shape of the Charter font.

These fonts conflict with the [[latex:package][amssymb]] package.

*** Garamond
# <<garamond-font>>

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamond][Garamond]] refers to a group of old-style serif typefaces and is named
after the sixteenth-century type designer, Claude Garamond.  It is an
elegant typeface.  Garamond requires a bit more leading than normal.
The sans-serif font is Latin Modern and the typewriter font is
Courier.  Both were chosen to match the shape and stroke weight of
Garamond.

# <<nimbus-font>>

The nimbus font set uses fonts from the Tex-Gyre distribution, which
provides a rich collection of diacritical characters in the attempt to
cover as many Latin-based scripts as possible.

The sans-serif font needs to be scaled down somehow.  I haven't
figured out how to do this.

# <<palatino-font>>

The beautiful, old-style serif font, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatino][Palatino]], was designed by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Zapf][Herman
Zapf]].  It is somewhat heavier and easier to read than [[garamond-font][Garamond]].
Palatino gets a bit more leading than normal.  It is paired here with
Helvetica and Courier, as is [[times-font][Times]], for which it is an alternative.

*** Times
# <<times-font>>

The =times= option uses URW Nimbus Roman, a Times clone, for the serif
font, URW Nimbus Sans, a Helvetica clone, for the sans-serif font,
and URW Nimbus Mono, a Courier clone, for the typewriter font.  This
is a standard set of common typefaces typically used in scientific
publications.  All of the fonts should be included in a typical LaTeX
distribution. 

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Roman][Times New Roman]] was designed by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Morison][Stanley Morison]] for /The Times/ of
London during a redesign of the newspaper prompted, in part, by
Morison's criticism of its typography in 1929.  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica][Helvetica]] was
developed in 1957 by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Miedinger][Max Miedinger]].  Helvetica looks better with Times
if it is set slightly smaller than the serif font.  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface)][Courier]] was
designed by Howard Kettler in 1955 for use in IBM typewriters.

*** Utopia
# <<utopia-font>>

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(typeface)][Utopia]] is a transitional serif font designed by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Slimbach][Robert Slimbach]] for
Adobe in 1989.  It became free software in 2006.  It is paired here
with the Bera sans serif and monospaced fonts.

Note that the utopia font clashes with the [[latex:package][amssymb]] package.

** Source block markup
Two options are available for syntax highlighting and typesetting of
source code blocks.  The [[latex:package][listings]] package is a pure LaTeX solution,
while the [[latex:package][minted]] package relies on [[latex:proglang][Python]] code and libraries.

#+source: pgf-option-source
#+begin_src latex :noweb tangle :exports code
  \pgfkeys{

*** Listings
The [[latex:package][listings]] package is a source code printer for LaTeX.  According to
posts in =comp.text.tex= in mid-2010, the [[latex:package][listings]] package is no
longer maintained.  

Caveat emptor: the line-breaking mechanism in the listings package
appears to break when [[latex:progexample][resetmargins = false]].  This means that the
listing will always be set to =\textwidth=, rather than =\linewidth=.
Thus, care should be taken to ensure that listings do not occur in
lists or other indented environments.  Probably the best way to ensure
that this doesn't happen is to make sure the =H:= option in the export
header is set to a suitably high level, so source code blocks always
occur at an [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] headline level that exports as a heading, rather
than a list, e.g. if source code appears in a three-asterisk headline
and no lower, then setting =H: 3= should ensure that listing margins
are always aligned with text margins.

You can choose to use the listings package by adding the following
line to the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] file:

#+source: org-buffer-listings
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [source=listings]
#+end_src

With this setting, default values are used to markup and typeset
source code blocks.

#+source: pgf-option-source-listings
#+begin_src latex :noweb tangle :exports code
  <<make-lstinline-macro>>
  \pgfkeys{ 
    /ORGART/.cd, 
    source/listings/.code={

        \RequirePackage{listings}
        <<listings-code>>
        <<make-lstnewenvironment-code>>
        <<make-lstinline-code>>
      }
    }
  }  
#+end_src

**** Listings setup

#+source: listings-setup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code :results silent
  (setq org-export-latex-listings 'listings)
  (setq org-export-latex-custom-lang-environments

          (latex "latexcode")))
  (setq org-latex-to-pdf-process
        '("pdflatex --shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode %s"))
#+end_src

**** Listings themes
Themes are defined for the listings package.  Themes treat source
blocks in all languages identically.  They are provided for
convenience.

#+source: pgf-option-listingstheme
#+begin_src latex :noweb tangle :exports code
  \newboolean{ORGART@color}
  \pgfkeys{ 
    /ORGART/.cd,

  <<pgf-option-listingstheme-bw>>
  <<pgf-option-listingstheme-color>>
  <<pgf-option-listingstheme-sv>>
  <<pgf-option-listingstheme-es>>
#+end_src


The =bw= theme offers footnote size text in a frame, set in black and
white with shades of gray.

#+source: org-buffer-listings-bw
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [listingstheme=bw]

          frame=lines,
          breaklines=true,
          showstringspaces=false}}}
  }
#+end_src

The =listings-color= theme was lifted from a post to the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] list
by Eric Schulte.

          frame=lines,
          breaklines=true,
          resetmargins=true}}}
  }
#+end_src

The =listings-sv= theme was posted to the list by Sebastian Vauban;
it has been modified here to work with the [[latex:package][color]] package, rather than
the [[latex:package][xcolor]] package used by Sebastien, and to allow breaking of long
lines.

**** Listings lookup table
This table has a column for each of the [[latex:package][listings]] variables likely relevant for
[[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] users.  The first two columns list the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] name for the
language and the name that the [[latex:package][listings]] package environment will have
for that language.  Note that these names should appear on the list
held by [[latex:progstruct][org-export-latex-custom-lang-environments]].  Note, too, that
the names all end in "code"; this is the default used by the [[latex:package][minted]]
package and it is used here to promote interoperability.

Default values are in the second row of the table.  These are used by
the [[latex:proglang][Python]] script to determine whether or not the variable should be
passed to the new LaTeX environment.  Note that the default value for
language has been set to =nil=.  This forces specification of a
language in the environment definition.

**** Make listings environments

This [[latex:proglang][Python]] script creates [[latex:progstruct][lstnewenvironment]] macros for each of the
languages in the listings-lookup table.

#+source: make-lstnewenvironment(x=listings-lookup)
#+begin_src python :results output raw :exports code
  res = ''
  rows = len(x)
  cols = len(x[0])
  for row in range(2,rows):  
      first = True
      s = '\\lstnewenvironment{' + x[row][1] +'}\n{\lstset{'
      for col in range(2,cols):
          if 'nil' != x[row][col] and x[row][col] != x[1][col]:
              if first:
                  s = s + x[0][col] + '=' + str(x[row][col])
                  first = False
              else:
                  s = s + ',' + x[0][col] + '=' + str(x[row][col])
      res = res + s + '}}\n{}\n'
  print res
#+end_src

#+source: make-lstnewenvironment-code
#+begin_src latex :noweb tangle :exports code
<<make-lstnewenvironment(x=listings-lookup)>>
#+end_src


**** Make inline list commands                                   

A LaTeX macro is used to define language-specific shortcuts for inline
listings with the [[latex:package][listings]] package.  It defines a newcommand
[[latex:progstruct][makelstinline]] that takes two arguments: the name of the new shortcut
command and the =key = value= options needed to configure the syntax
highlighting and typesetting.

#+source: make-lstinline-macro
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newcommand\makelstinline[2]{
    \def\makelstinline@shortname{#1}
    \expandafter\newcommand\csname\makelstinline@shortname\endcsname[1][]{ 
      \lstinline[#2]##1}}
#+end_src

This [[latex:proglang][Python]] code block uses the lookup table to create a call to
[[latex:progstruct][makelstinline]] for each of the languages in the table.

#+source: make-lstinline(x=lstinline-lookup)
#+begin_src python :results output raw :exports code
  res = ''
  rows = len(x)
  cols = len(x[0])
  for row in range(2,rows):  
      first = True
      s = '\\makelstinline{'+ x[row][1] +'}{'
      for col in range(2,cols):
          if 'nil' != x[row][col] and x[row][col] != x[1][col]:
              if first:
                  s = s + x[0][col] + '=' + str(x[row][col])
                  first = False
              else:
                  s = s + ',' + x[0][col] + '=' + str(x[row][col])
      res = res + s + '}\n'
  print res
#+end_src

This source block is used to put the LaTeX macros into the class file.

#+source: make-lstinline-code
#+begin_src latex :noweb tangle :exports code
<<make-lstinline(x=lstinline-lookup)>>
#+end_src


**** The listings configuration file

This source block writes a file, =orgart_listings.cfg=, that can be
used to input minted shortcuts into an Org-mode file that isn't using
[[latex:classfile][Org-article]].
#+source: listings-cfg
#+begin_src latex :tangle orgart_listings.cfg :noweb tangle :results raw :exports code
  <<make-lstnewenvironment(x=listings-lookup)>>
#+end_src


Typically, the configuration file would be input in the LaTeX header:
: #+LATEX_HEADER: \input{orgart_listings.cfg}


**** Listings code

This code defines three languages for the [[latex:package][listings]] package.  It also
defines a shell for the listings environment, which is defined and
used by the [[latex:package][minted]] package.

#+source: listings-code
#+begin_src latex :exports none
  \lstdefinelanguage{org}%
  {morekeywords={:results, :session, :var, :noweb, :exports},%
    sensitive=false,%
    morestring=[b]",%
    morecomment=[l]{\#}}%
  \lstdefinelanguage{dot}
  {morekeywords={graph},
    sensitive=false}
  \lstdefinelanguage{ditaa}{breaklines=false}
  \newfloat{listing}{h}{lol}
  \newcommand\listingscaption{Listing}
  \floatname{listing}{\listingscaption}
  \newcommand\listoflistingscaption{List of listings}
  \providecommand\listoflistings{\listof{listing}{\listoflistingscaption}}
#+end_src

*** Minted

Minted is a LaTeX package for formatting source code.  It is an
alternative to the listings package.  It relies on an external piece
of software called Pygments that needs to be installed separately.

**** Installing Pygments
On a Debian/Ubuntu linux system this can be done with

#+begin_src sh
sudo aptitude install python-pygments
#+end_src

**** Org-mode setup
You will need to set `org-export-latex-listings' to the special value
'minted.

#+source: minted-setup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code :results silent
  (setq org-export-latex-listings 'minted)
  (setq org-export-latex-custom-lang-environments
        '((python "pythoncode")
          (emacs-lisp "common-lispcode")
          (org "textcode")
          (latex "latexcode")))
  (setq org-latex-to-pdf-process
        '("pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"))
#+end_src

**** Using minted

To use minted to typeset source code blocks, add the following option.
#+source: org-buffer-minted
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [source=minted] 
#+end_src

#+source: pgf-option-source-minted
#+begin_src latex :noweb tangle :exports code
  \pgfkeys{ 
    /ORGART/.cd, 
    source/minted/.code={
      \newboolean{ORGARTminted}
      \AtEndOfClass{
        \RequirePackage{minted}
        <<make-newminted-code>>
        <<make-newmint-code>>
      }}
  }  
#+end_src

**** Minted styles
Minted defines styles, which are color schemes used in syntax highlighting
of code.  Minted styles are accessible with a =key = value= interface with
the option [[latex:progstruct][mintedstyle]].  

#+source: org-buffer-mintedstyle
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [mintedstyle=<style>]
#+end_src


The available options for <style> are:
   - monokai
   - perldoc
   - borland
   - colorful
   - murphy
   - trac
   - tango
   - fruity
   - autumn
   - vs
   - bw
   - emacs
   - pastie
   - friendly
   - native

#+BEGIN_listing
#+source: pgf-option-mintedstyle
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \pgfkeys{ 
    /ORGART/.cd, 
    mintedstyle/.is choice,
    mintedstyle/monokai/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\usemintedstyle{monokai}}},
    mintedstyle/manni/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\usemintedstyle{manni}}},
    mintedstyle/perldoc/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\usemintedstyle{perldoc}}},
    mintedstyle/borland/.code={\AtBeginDocument{\usemintedstyle{borland}}},

  } 
#+end_src

#+END_listing


**** Mark up code snippets
# <<markup-code-snippets>>

The class creates macros for marking up code snippets, using the
[[latex:progstruct][newmint]] command of the [[latex:package][minted]] package.  Adding a code snippet is as
easy as =C-c C-l mint:python x=str(y)=, which yields the following:

#+BEGIN_listing
 [[mint:python][x = str(y)]] 
#+END_listing

**** Newmint and newminted lookup table
These lookup tables hold configuration information for the the [[latex:package][minted]]
package.  The configuration information is used by a [[latex:proglang][Python]] script to
write out =\newmint{}= and =\newminted{}= macros.  These macros expand
to LaTeX environments that have access to the information needed to
highlight syntax and typeset a particular computer language.

Each row in the table holds information for a language
supported by [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]].  The first two columns contain the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]]
name for the language and the [[latex:package][minted]] name.  The other 29 columns are
for [[latex:package][minted]] variables.  The table is too large to reproduce on the
printed page, so a corner of it is presented here.


| Org          | Minted      | baselinestretch | bgcolor | firstline |
| *default*    | *default*   | auto            | nil     |         1 |
| asymptote    | asymptote   | auto            | nil     |         1 |
| C            | cpp         | auto            | nil     |         1 |
| clojure      | clojure     | auto            | nil     |         1 | 
| css          | css         | auto            | nil     |         1 |

The *default* row holds the [[latex:package][minted]] defaults.  The [[latex:proglang][Python]] scripts that
use the table to configure [[latex:package][minted]] use this row to determine whether or
not to write out a =key = value= pair to the [[latex:package][minted]] configuration in
the [[latex:classfile][Org-article]] class file.  A =nil= value in a cell of the table
indicates that the variable indicated in the column head is not set in
the minted configuration for that language.

The printed appearance of source code in any language is controlled by
changing entries in its row of variables and then tangling a new LaTeX
class file with =C-c C-v t=.  When the exported LaTeX source code is
compiled with the new class file, changes in the table will be
reflected on the pdf output.

**** Newmint lookup table                                          :noexport:

This table holds default minted values for each of the languages
supported by Org-mode.  You can change how minted typesets source code
snippets in any language by modifying the appropriate cell in the table.

**** Configuration file

This source block writes a file, =orgart_minted.cfg=, that can be used to input
minted shortcuts into an Org-mode file that isn't using [[latex:classfile][Org-article]].
#+source: minted-cfg
#+begin_src latex :tangle orgart_minted.cfg :noweb tangle :exports code
  <<make-newmint(x=newmint-lookup)>>
  <<make-newminted(x=newminted-lookup)>>  
#+end_src

Typically, the configuration file would be input in the LaTeX header:
: #+LATEX_HEADER: \input{orgart_minted.cfg}

** Other packages
Packages not included in the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] list of default packages are
made available in [[latex:classfile][Org-article]].  These include facilities to
apply microtypographic adjustments to suitable fonts, set the line
spacing of the document to double space, set lists more compactly than
the standard LaTeX [[latex:classfile][article]], and typeset source code listings
using one of several color or black and white themes.

*** Microtype

The [[latex:package][microtype]] package makes available the micro-typographic
extensions of pdfTeX.  Prominent among these are font expansion and
character protrusion, which together result in fewer bad line breaks
and a visually even right margin.  

You can probably read the [[latex:package][microtype]] documentation, which runs to
more than 200 pages, on your system by issuing the shell command:

#+source: read-microtype
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc microtype
#+end_src


This package is not loaded by default.  An option is provided to load
it.

#+source: org-buffer-microtype
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [microtype]
#+end_src

#+source: option-microtype
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{ORGART@microtype}
  \DeclareOption{microtype}{\setboolean{ORGART@microtype}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-microtype
#+begin_src latex :exports code
    \ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@microtype}}
  {%
    \ifpdf
     \RequirePackage{microtype}
    \fi}%
  {}
#+end_src

*** Setspace

The [[latex:package][setspace]] package is used here for the sole purpose of creating
double-spaced documents, such as manuscripts submitted to some
publishing houses.  If it is loaded, then the option [[latex:progstruct][doublespace]]
will produce a double-spaced document.

This package is not loaded by default.  An option is provided to load
it, and to set linespacing to doublespace.

#+source: org-buffer-setspace
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [setspace,doublespace]
#+end_src
 
#+source: option-setspace
#+begin_src latex :exports code

  \DeclareOption{setspace}{\setboolean{ORGART@setspace}{true}}
  \DeclareOption{doublespace}{\setboolean{ORGART@doublespace}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-setspace
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@setspace}}

#+end_src

#+source: setspace-code

  \ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@setspace}}%
  {\ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@doublespace}}%
  {\doublespacing}%
  {\singlespacing}}%
  {}%
#+end_src

*** Paralist

The [[latex:package][paralist]] package was designed to meet the widespread request for
more tightly set lists in the standard LaTeX classes.  If it is
loaded, then the LaTeX environments =itemize=, =enumerate=, and
=description= are over-ridden by their paralist counterparts.

You can probably read the [[latex:package][paralist]] documentation on your system by
issuing the shell command:

#+source: read-paralist
#+begin_src sh :exports code
  texdoc paralist
#+end_src


This package is not loaded by default.  An option is provided to load
it.

#+source: org-buffer-paralist
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [paralist]
#+end_src
 
#+source: option-paralist
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{ORGART@paralist}
  \DeclareOption{paralist}{\setboolean{ORGART@paralist}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-paralist
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  % Set the standard LaTeX list environments to their compact counterparts  
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@paralist}}
    {%
      \RequirePackage{paralist}
      \let\itemize\compactitem%
      \let\description\compactdesc%
      \let\enumerate\compactenum%
    }
    {}
#+end_src

*** Topcapt                                                        :noexport:
The [[latex:packgae][topcapt]] package is needed when it is desired to set the caption
of a table above the table.  In this case, the [[latex:progstruct][caption]] command
must be moved above the =tabular= environment and the command changed
to =\topcaption=.  These will be adjustments made to the code produced
by the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] LaTeX exporter.

This package is not loaded by default.  An option is provided to load
it.

#+source: org-buffer-topcapt
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [topcapt]
#+end_src

#+source: option-topcapt
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{topcapt}

*** Color                                                          :noexport:
The =xcolor= package provides facilities for adding color to LaTeX
output.  This package needs additional configuration.  It should take
options. 

#+source: org-buffer-color
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [color]
#+end_src

#+source: option-color
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{ORGART@color}
  \DeclareOption{color}{\setboolean{ORGART@color}{true}}  
#+end_src

#+source: load-color
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@color}}
    {\RequirePackage{color}}
    {}
#+end_src

*** GANTT charts
Eric Fraga wrote a GANTT chart constructor, powered by an [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]]
table.  It relies on two pieces of software:
  - a LaTeX package, [[latex:package][gantt.sty]], which you will need to download and
    install, and
  - an [[latex:proglang][Emacs lisp]] source code block in the  [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Library-of-Babel.html#Library-of-Babel][Library of Babel]].

[[latex:classfile][Org-article]] users will need to download the style file [[latex:package][gantt.sty]] and
install it, either in the directory in which the LaTeX file will be
compiled or at an appropriate place in the TeX directory structure.

The [[latex:progstruct][curl]] command works to grab [[latex:package][gantt.sty]] from Worg.  You can evaluate
this source code block with =C-c C-c=, or cut and paste it into
a shell and evaluate it there.

#+source: get-gantt.sty
#+begin_src sh
  curl http://repo.or.cz/w/Worg.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/code/latex/gantt.sty > gantt.sty
#+end_src

**** The GANTT Option

The [[latex:package][gantt.sty]] package can be loaded by adding the following line to the
[[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] buffer.

#+source: org-buffer-gantt
#+begin_src org :exports code
  #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [gantt]
#+end_src

The following two bits of code implement the [[latex:progstruct][gantt]] option in
[[latex:classfile][Org-article]].

#+source: option-gantt
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \newboolean{ORGART@gantt}
  \DeclareOption{gantt}{\setboolean{ORGART@gantt}{true}}
#+end_src

#+source: load-gantt
#+begin_src latex :exports code
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{ORGART@gantt}}
  {\RequirePackage{gantt}}
  {}
#+end_src

**** Preparing the input table

  The following table describes the tasks and other relevant
  information for a project.  Each line is an /entry/ and there are
  three types of entry allowed in this table:

  - task :: an actual task that has a start time, a duration and an end time.
  - milestone :: a specific milestone in the project that has a start
               time alone
  - date :: a point in time that will be drawn as a vertical line in the
          GANTT chart (e.g. start of each year).

  Each element of the chart will be annotated with the content of the
  /label/ column of each entry.  The first column of the table is
  ignored but I use it to number the entries.  The last column, titled
  /align/, is used to determine where to place the /activity/ text for
  tasks, whether to the left or right of the bar or, if nothing is
  specified, centred within the bar itself.

#+tblname: gantttesttable
    |    | type      | label | activity      | depends | start | duration | end | align |
    |----+-----------+-------+---------------+---------+-------+----------+-----+-------|

**** Creating the GANTT chart
In the [[latex:proglang][Org-mode]] buffer, the call to the code in the Library of Babel
passes =ganttesttable= to the function =elispgantt=.  Note that the
header argument is set in the function call.

#+begin_src org :exports code
,#+lob: elispgantt(table=gantttesttable) :results output latex
#+end_src

The results are wrapped in =#+BEGIN_LaTeX= ... =#+END_LaTeX=.

The resulting GANTT chart is processed by LaTeX and appears in the PDF
output without reference to an external file.  Note that the chart
does not appear in the HTML export.  The chart looks great, Eric!

** TODO Insert properties in text
Add macro to insert property values into exported text
=======================================================

you can use {{{property{NAME}}}} to insert the value of a
property upon export.

Thanks to David Maus for a patch to this effect.

** umlauts and other characters
Even better, for the OP, is to switch to the tex input method (M-x
set-input-method RET tex RET)!  In this case, you can type \"o to get ö.
Almost all TeX and LaTeX sequences are understood (e.g. \forall to get
∀, \exists for ∃, \alpha for α, \leftrightharpoons for ⇋, and so on.)
You can see all the characters with =describe-input-method=.

Will need to let LaTeX know that the input is UTF-8.  It works out of
the box for HTML.

Use org-special-blocks

Dear all,

Is there a way to include an abstract that suits both LaTeX export
and html export?

I am thinking in lines of
#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT:
My abstract goes here
#+END_ABSTRACT:
and have it interpreted differently depending on the export used.

If I'm not overlooking a hitch, you can do that now with the contributed package org-special-blocks. Just put

(require 'org-special-blocks)

in your .emacs.

The HTML abstract won't look like anything special until you style it, it will just be wrapped in a <div class="abstract"> element. Here are some sample style lines for your org document header (without line wraps):

#+STYLE: <style>.abstract {margin: 1em; padding: 1em; border: 1px solid black}
#+STYLE: .abstract:before {content: "ABSTRACT: ";}</style>

Alternatively, you could use the existing link syntax for this kind of
markup. See
http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-latex-export.php#sec-12

I'm all for using custom links to extend inline markup, but this is block-level, and thus handily extensible with org-special-blocks.

Cheers,

** Test conditional export

Will export nothing to HTML, and the resulting output to other
formats.

Values for 'exports' can be 'both', 'none', 'code' or 'results'; and
there are export flags latexp, htmlp, asciip, docbookp.

I tested the above example, and it "mostly" works. Sometimes not, and
I don't yet know why.

** HTML export
It should be possible to change the automatic conversion of Org-mode
link syntax into HTML links.  The test here could be when the FOLLOW
function assigned in org-add-link-type is nil.  This is an indication
that the link is being used in an extended way, and not as a link.
** TODO Take care of font clashes with amssymb
** Buffer local variables
What about making configuration variables buffer-local in the block
you execute? Once the buffer is killed, you should be back to your
previous configuration.

For example:

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (make-local-variable 'sentence-end-double-space)
 (setq sentence-end-double-space t)
 #+END_SRC
